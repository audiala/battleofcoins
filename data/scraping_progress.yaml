  description: 'About Bitcoin (BTC)

    Bitcoin (BTC) is the first cryptocurrency built on blockchain technology, also
    known as a decentralized digital currency that is based on cryptography. Unlike
    government-issued or fiat currencies such as US Dollars or Euro which are controlled
    by central banks, Bitcoin can operate without the need of a central authority
    like a central bank or a company. The decentralized nature allows it to operate
    on a peer-to-peer network whereby users are able to send funds to each other without
    going through intermediaries.

    Who created Bitcoin?

    The creator is an unknown individual or group that goes by the name Satoshi Nakamoto
    with the idea of an electronic peer-to-peer cash system as it is written in a
    whitepaper. Until today, the true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto has not been verified
    though there has been speculation and rumor as to who Satoshi might be. What we
    do know is that officially, the first genesis block of BTC was mined on 9th January
    2009, defining the start of cryptocurrencies.

    How does Bitcoin work?

    While the general public perceives Bitcoin as a physical looking coin, it is actually
    far from that. Under the hood, it is a distributed accounting ledger that is stored
    as a chain of blocks - hence the name blockchain.

    Let''s compare how Bitcoin is different from a commercial bank, which operates
    as a centralized system. Given a situation where Alice wants to transact with
    Bob, the bank is the only entity that holds the ledger that describes how much
    balance Alice and Bob has. As the bank maintains the ledger, they will do the
    verification as to whether Alice has enough funds to send to Bob. Finally when
    the transaction successfully takes place, the Bank will deduct Alice’s account
    and credit Bob’s account with the latest amount.

    Bitcoin conversely works in a decentralized manner. Since there is no central
    figure like a bank to verify the transactions and maintain the ledger, a copy
    of the ledger is distributed across Bitcoin nodes. A node is a piece of software
    that anybody can download and run to participate in the network. With that, everybody
    has a copy of how much balance Alice and Bob has, and there will be no dispute
    of fund balance.

    Now, if Alice were to transact with Bob using bitcoin. Alice will have to broadcast
    her transaction to the network that she intends to send $1 to Bob in equivalent
    amount of bitcoin. So how does the system determine if Alice has enough bitcoin
    to execute the transaction? This is where mining takes place.

    Bitcoin Mining

    A Bitcoin miner will use his or her computer rigs to validate Alice’s transaction
    to be added into the ledger. In order to stop a miner from adding any arbitrary
    transactions, they will need to solve a complex puzzle. Only if the miner is able
    to solve the puzzle (called the Proof of Work), which happens at random, then
    he or she is able to add the transactions into the ledger and the record is final.

    Since running computer rigs cost money due to capital expenditure, which includes
    the cost of the rigs and the cost of electricity, miners are rewarded with new
    supply of bitcoins. This is the monetary system behind Bitcoin, where the fees
    for validating transactions on the network is paid by the person who wishes to
    transact (in this case it is Alice).

    This makes the Bitcoin ledger resilient against fraud in a trustless manner. While
    it is resilient, there are still some risks associated with the system such as
    the 51% attack where by miners control more than 51% of the total computation
    power and also there can be security risks outside of the control of the Bitcoin
    protocol.

    How to keep your Bitcoin safe?

    When transacting coins, you would typically be doing it on your personal computer.
    Since your personal computer is connected to the internet, it has the potential
    to be infected by malware or spywares which could compromise your funds. 

    Hardware wallets such as Trezor and Ledger are strongly encouraged in mitigating
    that risk. These are external devices that look like USB sticks. A hardware wallet
    secures your private key that holds your Bitcoin into an external device outside
    of your personal computer. When you intend to transact, you would connect the
    hardware wallet into your personal computer, and all the key signing in order
    to transact would be done in the hardware itself outside of your computer.

    However, if you physically lose your hardware wallet without a key phrase backup,
    there is no other way of recovering your funds ever. As such when setting up your
    hardware wallet, always remember to keep a copy of the key phrase and put it somewhere
    safe from fire or flood.

    Bitcoin Halving

    Bitcoin Halving or sometimes also known as the Halvening, refers to the reduction
    of block reward to miners by half. This is part of its built-in monetary policy,
    in which after every approximately 4 years, the mining reward will be halved towards
    the limited capped supply of 21 million Bitcoin. Once 21 million of Bitcoin have
    been minted, there will no longer be new supply of it rewarded to miners, and
    miners are expected to earn revenue by way of transaction fees. In order to follow
    the real time of when the halving will take place, you can bookmark the CoinGecko''s
    bitcoin halving page.

    This is seen as a significant event for couple of reasons. Firstly, traders may
    speculate on the possible scarcity of Bitcoin making way to high volatility. Secondly,
    as miners'' rewards will be reduced, we may see some miners exiting the market
    as they could not sustain the lower profitability. This in turn may cause the
    hashing rate to reduce and mining pools may consolidate. Due to this, the bitcoin
    network may be a little unstable during the halving period.

  description: 'What is Ethereum?

    Ethereum is a Proof-of-Stake blockchain that powers decentralized applications
    (dApps) through smart contracts, without being controlled by a centralized entity.
    As the first blockchain to feature smart contracts, it has the largest ecosystem
    of decentralized applications, ranging from decentralized exchanges to crypto
    lending and borrowing platforms and more. 

    Ethereum is also home to numerous Layer 2 solutions that offer users a cheaper
    and faster way to process transactions on the blockchain. Some of these solutions
    include Arbitrum, which rolls up multiple transactions into a single transaction
    on Ethereum, and Polygon’s Proof-of-Stake chain, which is a sidechain that runs
    parallel to the Ethereum blockchain. 

    What Makes Ethereum Unique?

    Ethereum allows for the creation of ERC-20 tokens, which can be used as native
    tokens for the applications that live on the Ethereum blockchain. These tokens
    can be used for governance on their respective applications, for utility purposes
    such as paying trading fees, or as stores of value, as in the case of stablecoins
    like USDT and USDC. However, gas fees for transactions are still paid in ETH,
    as transactions are still recorded on the Ethereum blockchain.

    History of Ethereum

    The Ethereum project was initially conceived when Vitalik Buterin published the
    whitepaper in 2013. The yellowpaper, which consists of more technical details
    on how Ethereum would work, was later published by Gavin Wood in 2014. A fundraising
    sale was conducted in September 2014 and the network went live in July 2015. On
    15 September 2022, Ethereum transitioned from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake
    consensus with the Merge. 

    What’s Next for Ethereum?

    Now that the Merge is over, the final stage of Ethereum 2.0 is sharding, where
    the database on the Ethereum blockchain is split into 64 shard chains. With sharding,
    each validator only needs to verify the respective shards they’re responsible
    for, instead of verifying the entire network. This will also lower the barrier
    to entry for anyone who wishes to run a node. Besides encouraging further decentralization,
    this will improve scalability and ideally reduce the gas fees on the Ethereum
    network.

    What can Ether (ETH) be Used For?

    Ether (ETH) is the native coin that powers the Ethereum network and is used to
    pay for transactions. ETH functions as a utility token and is used to pay for
    gas fees for transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, denominated in gwei. Stakers
    on the Ethereum network earn ETH as their reward for securing the network. ETH
    is also a cryptocurrency, similar to bitcoin, and can be traded on multiple centralized
    and decentralized exchanges, or even deposited as collateral to take out loans.

    \ It has the largest stablecoins by circulation and market capitalization. \n\n\
    Who created Tether?\nTether is controlled by Tether Holding Limited or known as\
    \ Tether Limited. The CEO is JL Van Der Velde, the CFO is Giancarlo Devasini and\
    \ the general counsel is Suart Hoegner. \nTether was launched by the team running\
    \ Bitfinex, a major cryptocurrency exchange.\nHow does Tether work?\nTether was\
    \ originally based on the Omni Layer, a transport protocol on the Bitcoin blockchain.\
    \ Therefore, the original version of Tether is characterized by the inherent stability\
    \ and security of the longest established blockchain network.\nTo accelerate adoption,\
    \ in September 2017, Tether was launched on the Ethereum blockchain, as an ERC20\
    \ token. Tether’s Ethereum ERC-20 is now the most popular Tether token type. \n\
    Tether is available on Ethereum, Tron, EOS,Algorand, and more. You can see the\
    \ full breakdown on Tether’s Transparency page. \nOn 20th March 2020, Tether announced\
    \ that they will also be on the Bitcoin Cash network via the Simple Ledger Protocol.\n\
    How does Tether maintain a 1:1 USD peg?\nThe USDT peg is maintained via a one-to-one\
    \ collateral ratio. Tether Limited claims that every USDT in circulation is 100%\
    \ backed by actual fiat in their reserves. Tether published their balances in\
    \ their Transparency page. Tether Limited acts as a third-party custodian for\
    \ the fiat currencies backing USDT. \nTo understand the process of how Tether\
    \ is controlled by Tether Limited, take a look at the flow of fund process below:\n\
    \nStep 1:­ User deposits fiat currency into Tether Limited's bank account. \n\
    Step 2:­ Tether Limited generates and credits the user's Tether account. Tether\
    \ enters into circulation. Amount of fiat currency deposited by the user must\
    \ be equal to the amount of Tether issued to the user (E.g.: 500 USD deposited\
    \ = 500 USDT issued)\nStep 3­: User transacts with USDT. The user can transfer,\
    \ exchange, and store USDT.\nStep 4:­ The user deposits USDT with Tether Limited\
    \ for redemption into fiat currency. \nStep 5:­ Tether Limited destroys the Tether\
    \ and sends fiat currency to the user’s bank account. \nUsers can also obtain\
    \ Tether outside of the aforementioned process via an exchange or another individual. \n\
    What is the purpose of Tether?\n\n\nStable Currency\n\tTether converts fiat US\
    \ Dollar into blockchain stablecoins and expedites the transaction to other cryptocurrencies\
    \ compared to using regular fiat currencies. \n\n\nWide Acceptance\n\tTether acts\
    \ as an alternative for deposit/withdrawal and has become a popular trading pair\
    \ across major exchanges as it provides ease of use in calculating profit and\
    \ loss for traders. The wide acceptance of Tether makes it convenient for users\
    \ to move their USD holdings seamlessly between their wallets and exchanges."
