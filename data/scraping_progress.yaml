  description: 'About Bitcoin (BTC)

    Bitcoin (BTC) is the first cryptocurrency built on blockchain technology, also
    known as a decentralized digital currency that is based on cryptography. Unlike
    government-issued or fiat currencies such as US Dollars or Euro which are controlled
    by central banks, Bitcoin can operate without the need of a central authority
    like a central bank or a company. The decentralized nature allows it to operate
    on a peer-to-peer network whereby users are able to send funds to each other without
    going through intermediaries.

    Who created Bitcoin?

    The creator is an unknown individual or group that goes by the name Satoshi Nakamoto
    with the idea of an electronic peer-to-peer cash system as it is written in a
    whitepaper. Until today, the true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto has not been verified
    though there has been speculation and rumor as to who Satoshi might be. What we
    do know is that officially, the first genesis block of BTC was mined on 9th January
    2009, defining the start of cryptocurrencies.

    How does Bitcoin work?

    While the general public perceives Bitcoin as a physical looking coin, it is actually
    far from that. Under the hood, it is a distributed accounting ledger that is stored
    as a chain of blocks - hence the name blockchain.

    Let''s compare how Bitcoin is different from a commercial bank, which operates
    as a centralized system. Given a situation where Alice wants to transact with
    Bob, the bank is the only entity that holds the ledger that describes how much
    balance Alice and Bob has. As the bank maintains the ledger, they will do the
    verification as to whether Alice has enough funds to send to Bob. Finally when
    the transaction successfully takes place, the Bank will deduct Alice’s account
    and credit Bob’s account with the latest amount.

    Bitcoin conversely works in a decentralized manner. Since there is no central
    figure like a bank to verify the transactions and maintain the ledger, a copy
    of the ledger is distributed across Bitcoin nodes. A node is a piece of software
    that anybody can download and run to participate in the network. With that, everybody
    has a copy of how much balance Alice and Bob has, and there will be no dispute
    of fund balance.

    Now, if Alice were to transact with Bob using bitcoin. Alice will have to broadcast
    her transaction to the network that she intends to send $1 to Bob in equivalent
    amount of bitcoin. So how does the system determine if Alice has enough bitcoin
    to execute the transaction? This is where mining takes place.

    Bitcoin Mining

    A Bitcoin miner will use his or her computer rigs to validate Alice’s transaction
    to be added into the ledger. In order to stop a miner from adding any arbitrary
    transactions, they will need to solve a complex puzzle. Only if the miner is able
    to solve the puzzle (called the Proof of Work), which happens at random, then
    he or she is able to add the transactions into the ledger and the record is final.

    Since running computer rigs cost money due to capital expenditure, which includes
    the cost of the rigs and the cost of electricity, miners are rewarded with new
    supply of bitcoins. This is the monetary system behind Bitcoin, where the fees
    for validating transactions on the network is paid by the person who wishes to
    transact (in this case it is Alice).

    This makes the Bitcoin ledger resilient against fraud in a trustless manner. While
    it is resilient, there are still some risks associated with the system such as
    the 51% attack where by miners control more than 51% of the total computation
    power and also there can be security risks outside of the control of the Bitcoin
    protocol.

    How to keep your Bitcoin safe?

    When transacting coins, you would typically be doing it on your personal computer.
    Since your personal computer is connected to the internet, it has the potential
    to be infected by malware or spywares which could compromise your funds. 

    Hardware wallets such as Trezor and Ledger are strongly encouraged in mitigating
    that risk. These are external devices that look like USB sticks. A hardware wallet
    secures your private key that holds your Bitcoin into an external device outside
    of your personal computer. When you intend to transact, you would connect the
    hardware wallet into your personal computer, and all the key signing in order
    to transact would be done in the hardware itself outside of your computer.

    However, if you physically lose your hardware wallet without a key phrase backup,
    there is no other way of recovering your funds ever. As such when setting up your
    hardware wallet, always remember to keep a copy of the key phrase and put it somewhere
    safe from fire or flood.

    Bitcoin Halving

    Bitcoin Halving or sometimes also known as the Halvening, refers to the reduction
    of block reward to miners by half. This is part of its built-in monetary policy,
    in which after every approximately 4 years, the mining reward will be halved towards
    the limited capped supply of 21 million Bitcoin. Once 21 million of Bitcoin have
    been minted, there will no longer be new supply of it rewarded to miners, and
    miners are expected to earn revenue by way of transaction fees. In order to follow
    the real time of when the halving will take place, you can bookmark the CoinGecko''s
    bitcoin halving page.

    This is seen as a significant event for couple of reasons. Firstly, traders may
    speculate on the possible scarcity of Bitcoin making way to high volatility. Secondly,
    as miners'' rewards will be reduced, we may see some miners exiting the market
    as they could not sustain the lower profitability. This in turn may cause the
    hashing rate to reduce and mining pools may consolidate. Due to this, the bitcoin
    network may be a little unstable during the halving period.

  description: 'What is Ethereum?

    Ethereum is a Proof-of-Stake blockchain that powers decentralized applications
    (dApps) through smart contracts, without being controlled by a centralized entity.
    As the first blockchain to feature smart contracts, it has the largest ecosystem
    of decentralized applications, ranging from decentralized exchanges to crypto
    lending and borrowing platforms and more. 

    Ethereum is also home to numerous Layer 2 solutions that offer users a cheaper
    and faster way to process transactions on the blockchain. Some of these solutions
    include Arbitrum, which rolls up multiple transactions into a single transaction
    on Ethereum, and Polygon’s Proof-of-Stake chain, which is a sidechain that runs
    parallel to the Ethereum blockchain. 

    What Makes Ethereum Unique?

    Ethereum allows for the creation of ERC-20 tokens, which can be used as native
    tokens for the applications that live on the Ethereum blockchain. These tokens
    can be used for governance on their respective applications, for utility purposes
    such as paying trading fees, or as stores of value, as in the case of stablecoins
    like USDT and USDC. However, gas fees for transactions are still paid in ETH,
    as transactions are still recorded on the Ethereum blockchain.

    History of Ethereum

    The Ethereum project was initially conceived when Vitalik Buterin published the
    whitepaper in 2013. The yellowpaper, which consists of more technical details
    on how Ethereum would work, was later published by Gavin Wood in 2014. A fundraising
    sale was conducted in September 2014 and the network went live in July 2015. On
    15 September 2022, Ethereum transitioned from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake
    consensus with the Merge. 

    What’s Next for Ethereum?

    Now that the Merge is over, the final stage of Ethereum 2.0 is sharding, where
    the database on the Ethereum blockchain is split into 64 shard chains. With sharding,
    each validator only needs to verify the respective shards they’re responsible
    for, instead of verifying the entire network. This will also lower the barrier
    to entry for anyone who wishes to run a node. Besides encouraging further decentralization,
    this will improve scalability and ideally reduce the gas fees on the Ethereum
    network.

    What can Ether (ETH) be Used For?

    Ether (ETH) is the native coin that powers the Ethereum network and is used to
    pay for transactions. ETH functions as a utility token and is used to pay for
    gas fees for transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, denominated in gwei. Stakers
    on the Ethereum network earn ETH as their reward for securing the network. ETH
    is also a cryptocurrency, similar to bitcoin, and can be traded on multiple centralized
    and decentralized exchanges, or even deposited as collateral to take out loans.

  description: 'About Solana (SOL)

    Solana is a Layer 1 blockchain that offers users fast speeds and affordable costs.
    It supports smart contracts and facilitates the creation of decentralized applications
    (dApps). Projects built on Solana include a variety of DeFi platforms as well
    as NFT marketplaces, where users can buy Solana-based NFT projects. Its high performance
    means Solana doesn’t require a traditional scaling Layer 2 solution; instead,
    Layer 2s on Solana focus on interoperability and connecting Solana to other chains. 

    Solana combines the Proof-of-History (PoH) consensus mechanism alongside the more
    common Proof-of-Stake. This ensures Solana achieves consensus more quickly while
    reducing the workload and solving the blockchain trilemma, where developers have
    to balance decentralization, security, and scalability.

    What is Proof of History?

    Proof-of-History is a time-based consensus mechanism that develops a historical
    record of an activity based on its position in the blockchain, which is represented
    by a hash tree. This lets any node quickly verify the order of all transactions
    by checking the hashes on the hash tree, allowing for fast and efficient validation
    without requiring the nodes to store the full history of every transaction. 

    Who founded Solana?

    Anatoly Yakovenko, Solana''s main founder, created the first version of Proof-of-History
    (PoH) in 2017. Teaming up with Raj Gokal, Greg Fitzgerald, and Stephen Akridge,
    they worked on building a high-performance blockchain that would solve scalability
    issues faced by popular blockchains like Ethereum, which often became slow and
    expensive at times of high demand. Solana Labs was launched in 2018 to support
    these efforts, and Solana was officially launched in 2020.

    What can Solana be used for?

    With its fast transactions and low gas fees, Solana has attracted many developers
    to build their protocols on its blockchain. Today, the Solana ecosystem consists
    of a diverse range of projects, such as:


    DEXs like Radium allow users to swap tokens on Solana. Users can also provide
    liquidity to earn trading fees.

    DePIN projects like Helium reward users for providing physical infrastructure
    resources such as wireless connectivity and data storage.

    Liquid Staking protocols like Jito allow users to deposit their assets on the
    platform and be rewarded with liquid staking tokens.

    Memecoins like dogwifhat and Book of Meme


    Solana Outages

    Solana has faced recurring network outages, totaling eight major and ten partial
    incidents at the time of writing. These have ranged from a 17-hour downtime in
    September 2021 to a 5-hour outage in February 2024, caused by issues like bot
    transactions and bugs.

    In response, Solana''s team has implemented various upgrades such as a new data
    transfer protocol called QUIC, a stake-weighted Quality-of-Service to ensure transaction
    packets are sent to the leader, and local fee markets to send priority fees to
    validators.

    Solana Key Events

    The Solana team has been working hard improving its blockchain and ecosystem.
    One example is Solana’s growing validator client diversity with Jito Labs, Firedancer
    and Sig, which is important for blockchain resilience and decentralization as
    it minimizes the risk of bugs and any single client compromising the entire chain.

    Secondly, Solana introduces its new compiler Solang that is compatibility with
    Ethereum Solidity. It allows Ethereum smart contract developers to deploy smart
    contracts on Solana without Rust or C, Solana’s primary programming language.

    In 2023, Solana has unveiled its own Web3 smartphone Saga with a native store
    for dApps. Unfortunately, the Saga received negative reviews with a YouTuber MKBHD
    stating that the features didn’t justify the US$1,000 price tag.

    What is the utility of SOL token?

    SOL is the native token of the Solana blockchain. It can be used to pay for transaction
    fees (also known as gas fees) when sending transactions or interacting with smart
    contracts. It can also be used to secure the network through staking. Users can
    either stake their SOL directly, or delegate their holdings to an active validator
    in exchange for a share of the rewards.

  description: 'What is BNB (BNB)?

    BNB (BNB), previously also known as Binance Coin (BNB), is a cryptocurrency coin created
    and issued by the cryptocurrency exchange Binance. Initially created on the Ethereum
    blockchain as an ERC-20 token in July 2017, BNB was migrated over to BNB Smart
    Chain in February 2019 and became the native coin of the Binance Chain.

    BNB can be used to pay for fees when trading on Binance, and usually at a discounted
    rate. Due to the primary utility, BNB has seen massive growth in interest throughout
    the years . Several rounds of token burn events have appreciated BNB price and
    pushed it up as one of the top-10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. 

    What is Binance?

    Binance is the cryptocurrency exchange founded by Changpeng Zhao and He Yi in
    July 2017. Binance started with an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) and has since grown
    into one of the largest global cryptocurrency exchanges, both in terms of volume
    traded and market share by web traffic. The Binance exchange is separated into
    the Spot market, Futures market, as well as the decentralized exchange, Binance
    DEX.

    What can you use BNB for?

    BNB was initially created as part of the Binance exchange through its ICO. In
    its whitepaper, Binance states that BNB was designed to be used to pay discounted
    fees on the Binance platform and also function as the native token powering the
    Binance Chain.

    In addition to the initial use cases, BNB has added other cases both on and outside
    of the Binance platforms. Here’s an overview of BNB use cases:



    Reduced Trading Fees - When trading fees on Binance are paid using BNB, users
    are entitled to a 25% discount in fees.



    Binance Account Tier - Users with account balances in BNB and 30 days accumulated
    trading volume above certain thresholds are given VIP tiers with additional fee
    discounts and perks.



    Dust Conversion - Users can convert non-tradeable amounts of various cryptocurrencies
    called dust in their Binance account into BNB. 



    IEO Lottery - Binance’s Initial Exchange Offerings (IEO) are conducted using lottery
    allocations determined using the amount of BNB held by users. 



    Binance Chain Native Token - Much like how Ether (ETH) is used to pay for fees
    on the Ethereum Blockchain, BNB is used to pay for fees on the Binance Chain.
    BNB is needed to trade on the Binance DEX.



    Spent as Cryptocurrency - In addition to being used on Binance’s platforms, BNB
    can also be spent for payments in various ways, such as paying for travels, credit
    card fees, gifts and more. The full list is available here.



    There may be more ways to use BNB that have not been covered here, but generally
    BNB can be used like any other cryptocurrencies to pay for goods and services
    as long as the merchant accepts it.

    BNB (BNB) Burn

    BNB (BNB) is designed with token burn in mind to induce scarcity and drive up
    the value of the token. In its v1.1 whitepaper (archived copy), Binance stated
    that 20% of Binance’s profits will be used to purchase BNB and subsequently destroyed
    in every quarter. In 2019, Binance updated its whitepaper to v1.2. In the updated
    whitepaper, it is stated that BNB burns will now be based on its exchanges’ trading
    volume.

    Since Binance began burning BNB in Oct 2017, 10 rounds of token burns have taken
    place, with about 16.7 million BNB worth approximately $208 million burned up
    till January 2020.

    Holding and Storing BNB (BNB)

    BNB (BNB) is supported by various hardware and software wallet providers. The
    choice between hardware and software wallets is mostly a balancing act between
    convenience and security to the user. We’ll provide a quick rundown on them in
    this section.

    Generally, hardware wallets (e.g. Ledger) are non-custodial wallets which keep
    private keys of a wallet offline and only the owner knows it. This is arguably
    the safest option for storage as the user has full ownership of the coins, but
    is likely the least convenient as it requires the user to operate additional hardware
    to spend/use the cryptocurrency. 

    Non-custodial software wallets (e.g. Trust Wallet, Atomic Wallet) is the next
    option in terms of safety compared to hardware wallets, although they are likely
    more convenient. The private keys are also owned by the user, but since the wallet
    is kept on an online device (eg. the phone), there is a higher risk of losing
    the funds as hackers can access devices which are connected to the internet.

    Lastly, arguably the most convenient yet risky storage method would be storing
    funds on custodial wallets (eg. on a centralized exchange such as Binance) as
    users do not own the private keys to the funds. A hack on the storage location
    can potentially cause users to lose their funds, much like what happened during
    the infamous 2014 Mt. Gox hack which recorded a massive loss of 850,000 BTC, most
    of which are customer funds.

    Check out the full list of wallets which supports BNB on Binance’s own updated
    list here.

    Are there any BNB (BNB) Derivatives?

    Yes, if you are looking to enter a long or short BNB position, both perpetual
    swaps and futures are available for BNB. Perpetual swap trading pairs are available
    across several platforms, including on Binance’s very own derivative exchange,
    Binance Futures with the BNBUSDT perpetual swap pair.

    Check out the full list of derivative products or derivative exchanges listed
    on CoinGecko.'

  description: 'What is Ripple?

    Ripple is a privately-held fintech company that provides a global payment solution
    via its patented payment network called Ripple Network (also known as RippleNet).
    RippleNet is a payment network that is built on top of Ripple’s consensus ledger,
    called XRP Ledger (also known as XRPL). Ripple funded the development of the open-source
    XRP Ledger.

    Unlike most cryptocurrencies out there that cater to peer-to-peer needs, Ripple
    was made to connect banks, payment providers and digital asset exchanges, enabling
    real-time settlement expeditions and lower transaction fees.

    What is the XRP Ledger?

    XRP Ledger (XRPL) is the open-source distributed ledger that is created by Ripple.
    The native cryptocurrency of the XRP Ledger is XRP. Compared to Bitcoin (BTC)
    which uses a distributed blockchain whose transactions are processed and secured
    by proof-of-work mining, XRP transactions are processed by a network of trusted
    validators on the XRP Ledger

    Ripple transactions are publicly recorded on its open-source distributed consensus
    ledger which has a similar data structure to a blockchain where the successive
    data block includes the hash of the previous block. However, its consensus mechanism
    is different from Bitcoin or Ethereum. It does not rely on Proof of Work (PoW)
    and therefore there is no mining involved with XRP.

    XRP instead relies on a consensus algorithm known as the Ripple Protocol Consensus
    Algorithm. The XRPL’s integrity is maintained by a group of trusted nodes. All
    transactions must be agreed by a supermajority of these trusted nodes for it to
    achieve consensus and be included in the XRP Ledger.

    How does it reach a consensus if there is no mining?

    XRPL uses a different set of rules called the Ripple Consensus Protocol Algorithm
    (RCPA). The RCPA defines how XRPL is managed by a network of independent Ripple
    validator nodes. Any Ripple transaction needs to be verified by at least 80% of
    the nodes on the network.

    Anyone can become a validator. However, Ripple maintains a given set of validators
    that can be trusted. This trusted list of nodes is called the Unique Node List
    (UNL).

    If Alice wants to send 1,000 Japanese Yen to her cousin Bob in India, Alice could
    send it to the participating financial institutions. The JPY will be converted
    to XRP and will be validated by the servers in the network. Bob could withdraw
    the money in Indian Rupee once validated. The remittance can be done within seconds.


    What is the difference between XRP, XRP Ledger, Ripple, and Ripple Network?



    XRP is the native token and the ticker symbol of the XRP Ledger 



    XRP Ledger is the distributed consensus ledger 



    Ripple (formerly known as Ripple Labs) is the company behind Ripple Network 



    Ripple Network is a global network payment built on top of the XRP Ledger 



    Who created Ripple?

    Ripple was first started in 2004 by Ryan Fugger, who developed the first version
    of Ripple, called RipplePay. n 2012, Fugger handed it to Jed McCaleb and Chris
    Larsen, where they co-founded OpenCoin. In 2013, OpenCoin then rebranded to Ripple
    Labs Incorporated. In 2016, Ripple Labs rebranded to Ripple. Chris is currently
    the Executive Chairman of Ripple. 

    Jed McCaleb was previously the founder of Mt. Gox, the first Bitcoin exchange.
    He had a falling out with the Ripple team and forked the Ripple codebase to start
    Stellar. He is currently the CTO of Stellar. Brad Garlinghouse is currently the
    CEO of Ripple.

    What is the purpose of Ripple?


    a. Mediator. There are many currencies that can''t be converted directly to each
    other. For example, if you want to convert currency A to currency B, you will
    need to do a double conversion: Currency A to USD and USD to Currency B. In this
    case, USD is the mediator that acts as a global bridge that connects different
    fiat currencies from the originators to the beneficiaries. XRP holds the same
    role but it is much cheaper than USD. The cost of a transaction on the Ripple
    protocol is about 0.00001 XRP and currently, 1 XRP price is at ~$0.15, which would
    cost you next to nothing.

    b. Fast remittance. Compared with the traditional remittance market, it can take
    up to 48 hours to transfer your money internationally. However, the average transaction
    time using XRP is 4 seconds. 

    Can Ripple create more XRP?

    No. XRP has been pre-mined with a supply cap of 100 billion tokens. 

    Is Ripple different from Bitcoin?



    The total supply of XRP is capped at 100 billion while the total supply of Bitcoin
    is capped at 21 million.



    XRP’s average transaction speed is 4 seconds while Bitcoin’s transaction speed
    is 10 minutes.



    XRP Ledger could handle 1,500 transactions per second, which is 600 times faster
    than Bitcoin. Bitcoin can only handle an average of around 2.5 transactions per
    second.



    While XRP outperforms Bitcoin in terms of transactions per second, it has a different
    underlying consensus mechanism (trusted validators on XRP Ledger vs. distributed
    miners on Bitcoin) and therefore does not offer the same security that Bitcoin
    offers.


    XRP’s transaction fee is 0.00001 XRP (roughly $0.000001), while Bitcoin’s transaction
    fee is about $0.50-$1.00 per transaction.

  description: 'What is Dogecoin?

    Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency created on December 6th, 2013 based on the popular
    "Doge" Internet meme and features a Shiba Inu on its logo. The codebase of the
    project was a fork of Litecoin, so it inherited many of the same features such
    as the hashing algorithm, with the only difference being branding and large inflationary
    supply.

    One of Dogecoin''s strengths is its relaxed and fun-loving community. But like
    most meme coins, this is also a weakness because other currencies are seen as
    more professional.

    History of Dogecoin

    Dogecoin was created by Billy Markus from Portland, Oregon, and Jackson Palmer
    from Sydney, Australia. They wanted to create a fun cryptocurrency that would
    appeal beyond the core Bitcoin audience.

    Introduced as a "joke currency", Dogecoin quickly developed its own online community
    and reached a capitalization of US$60 million in January 2014. Compared with other
    cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin had a fast initial coin production schedule: 100 billion
    coins were in circulation by mid-2015, with an additional 5.256 billion coins
    every year thereafter. As of 30 June 2015, the 100 billionth Dogecoin had been
    mined.

    What is the utility of the DOGE token?

    DOGE is primarily used as a tipping system on Reddit and Twitter, where users
    tip each other for creating or sharing good content. The community is very active
    in organizing fundraising activities for deserving causes.

  description: 'About Cardano (ADA)

    Cardano is a proof-of-stake blockchain network that supports decentralized applications
    (dApps) with a multi-asset ledger and smart contracts. Unlike many other blockchains,
    Cardano does not build on top of technical foundations from Bitcoin or other blockchains.
    Instead Cardano works with leading academics on research to develop new and innovative
    solutions, which are subjected to academic peer review and presented at major
    international conferences. The team then builds a prototype to understand real-world
    technical and functional implementation issues, enabling the creation of technical
    specifications before formal development begins.

    On 22 September 2022, Cardano implemented the Vasil hard fork. The Vasil hard
    fork is intended to improve smart contract capabilities, increase the chain’s
    throughput and reduce costs, while also enhancing transaction validation.

    What Makes Cardano Unique?

    Cardano uses a unique Proof-of-Stake mechanism known as Ouroboros, where transactions
    are verified by splitting the chains into epochs, which are in turn segmented
    into time slots. For every time slot, a new slot leader is elected and is responsible
    for adding a block to the chain for their assigned slot. As each epoch can be
    partitioned infinitely, the Cardano blockchain is theoretically infinitely scalable,
    making it possible to run multiple transactions simultaneously.

    History of Cardano

    Cardano was founded in 2015 by Charles Hoskinson, one of the founding members
    of Ethereum. The development of Cardano was funded through an initial coin offering
    in 2017, which raised over $60 million. The first version of Cardano’s blockchain
    was launched in September 2017, which focused on establishing the Cardano Settlement
    Layer and the Ouroboros consensus algorithm. In the next phase, Cardano focused
    on optimizing decentralization by shifting in favor of community-run nodes. Next
    came smart contracts and the creation of decentralized applications, and Cardano
    is now in the scaling phase, which is focused on enhancing its performance and
    stability. 

    What’s Next for Cardano?

    The next stage for Cardano will be the Voltaire era of Cardano, after which the
    Cardano network will become a self-sustaining system with its own voting and treasury
    system, where network participants can use their stake and voting rights to influence
    the development of the Cardano network. Network participants will also be able
    to present improvement proposals to be voted on, and a fraction of transaction
    fees will be set aside to fund development activities after votes have taken place.

    What Can ADA Be Used For?

    ADA is the native coin of Cardano, and it is named after Ada Lovelace, who is
    recognized as the first computer programmer. At the moment, ADA holders can delegate
    their coins to a stake pool to earn staking rewards for securing the network.
    Also, ADA tokens are needed to pay for transaction fees on the Cardano platform.
    Eventually, ADA will also confer voting rights upon its holders, who can then
    vote on future changes to the network.

  description: 'What is Lido Staked Ether?

    Lido Staked Ether (stETH) is a token that represents your staked ether in Lido,
    combining the value of initial deposit and staking rewards. stETH tokens are minted
    upon deposit and burned when redeemed.

    While the price of stETH to ETH is based on the market demand, stETH token balances
    are pegged 1:1 to the ethers that are staked by Lido and the token’s balances
    are updated daily to reflect earnings and rewards. At this moment, stETH price
    can deviate from 1 ETH as it is currently not possible to claim the underlying
    ETH until Ethereum 2.0 fully merges. stETH tokens can be used as one would use
    ether, allowing you to earn ETH 2.0 staking rewards whilst benefiting from e.g.
    yields across decentralised finance products.

    As of June 11, 2022, 1 stETH is worth 0.955 ETH due to liquidity issue and supposed
    additional risks due to the delay of the merge alongside with DAO/smart contract
    risks.'

  description: 'What is Avalanche?

    Avalanche is a general-purpose blockchain platform founded by Cornell University
    professor Emin Gün Sirer. Developers can deploy decentralized applications such
    as decentralized finance, gaming, and NFTs via smart contracts. Validators secure
    the network through a proof-of-stake consensus protocol, which allows for fast and
    low-cost transaction processing.

    How Does Avalanche Work?

    There are three different blockchains that form the Avalanche network.


    The Exchange Chain (X-Chain) is the primary blockchain for asset creation and
    exchange, including AVAX.

    The Contract Chain (C-Chain) supports the creation and execution of smart contracts
    with its Avalanche Virtual Machine, which is based on the Ethereum Virtual Machine
    (EVM)

    The Platform Chain (P-Chain) manages the network of validators.


    What is AVAX Token?

    AVAX token is Avalanche’s native currency. It is used to pay transaction fees,
    and users can participate in securing the network by staking AVAX tokens.'

  description: "What is Tron (TRX)?\nTron is a blockchain-based decentralized operating\
    \ system much like Ethereum that aims to advance the decentralization of the Internet\
    \ and its infrastructure. At its core, Tron is a smart contract platform that\
    \ offers high throughput, high scalability, and high availability for all Decentralized\
    \ Applications (DApps) in the TRON ecosystem. The Tron blockchain is built around\
    \ the usability of its native token, Tronix (TRX).\nWho created Tron?\nThe Tron\
    \ blockchain was created by Tron Foundation, a Singapore-based organization that\
    \ is currently headed by Justin Sun. Prior to creating the Tron Foundation, Sun\
    \ founded Peiwo, an app that aspires to be the Asian Snapchat. This app got Sun\
    \ into the 2017 Forbes 30 under 30 list. \nSun was also the former Chief Representative\
    \ of Ripple in China and a graduate of Hupan University.\nTron came about after\
    \ a successful ICO which raised over $70 million in September 2017.\nWhat is the\
    \ Value of Tron?\nUsing the blockchain and its decentralized smart contract capability,\
    \ the idea of Tron is that users will experience a decentralized internet where\
    \ “middlemen” such as Google and Facebook are not needed for users to access content.\n\
    To draw an example, currently the most ubiquitous video sharing platform is Youtube,\
    \ which is a privately owned company with privately owned servers that stores\
    \ and serves video to its viewers. However, using Youtube’s services means that\
    \ creators and users have to comply with Youtube's terms of service and may have\
    \ to pay for its content in one way or another. Creators on the Youtube platform\
    \ may earn a share of Youtube’s revenue, but the pay structure is entirely up\
    \ to Youtube’s discretion. \nTron aims to replace services such as Youtube and\
    \ others by becoming the decentralized infrastructure in which users can connect\
    \ directly with creators and pay the creators directly for the content they wish\
    \ to consume.\nHow does the Tron Blockchain work?\nThe TRON protocol runs on a\
    \ Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) Governance Model. This allows users to perform\
    \ transactions with close to zero-fee whilst still being resistant towards transaction\
    \ spam. \nTransactions on the Tron Blockchain are maintained by a consortium of\
    \ Super Representatives (SR) that are voted in by TRX holders who have locked\
    \ their stake in the form of Tron Power. There are 27 top-voted Super Representatives\
    \ and 100 Super Representative Candidates. The hierarchy of SR and SR Candidates\
    \ are readjusted every 6 hours based on the number of votes they receive from\
    \ Tron Power holders. \nCan I mine Tron?\nNo, you can’t mine Tron because Tron\
    \ runs on a Delegated Proof of Stake consensus algorithm. This is different from\
    \ Bitcoin which uses the Proof of Work algorithm. New Tron tokens are created\
    \ as block rewards for elected Super Representatives. This serves as an incentive\
    \ to the Super Representatives in maintaining the integrity of the Tron network.\
    \ You can participate by staking your TRX and voting for your desired Super Representative.\n\
    What can I do on Tron?\nAt its core, Tron is a smart contract platform. Specifically,\
    \ it is built to be Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible, meaning it has\
    \ a Turing complete virtual machine capability. Executing smart contracts on Tron\
    \ is similar to Ethereum. \nOn the other hand, whilst Ethereum operates on the\
    \ gas fee transaction model, Tron operates on the Bandwidth model, which is similar\
    \ to that of EOS. This is how transactions on Tron can be much cheaper and more\
    \ seamless than Ethereum.\nJust as one can issue smart contract tokens such as\
    \ ERC-20, ERC-1155 and others on Ethereum, it is also possible to issue smart\
    \ contract tokens on the Tron too. There are currently 2 token standards possible\
    \ on Tron, namely TRC10 and TRC20. \nVarious TRC10 and TRC20 tokens have been\
    \ issued on Tron with various use cases.\nWhat can I use TRX for?\nThere are numerous\
    \ Decentralized Appliactions (Dapps) built on the Tron Blockchain, many of which\
    \ require the use of the native Tronix (TRX) token. You can easily swap your TRX\
    \ for TRC10 tokens which are used by many Dapps on the Tron Blockchain such as\
    \ BitTorrent,888Tron and others.\nHow to store TRX?\nThe Tron Foundation has made\
    \ it very easy for users to store and utilize TRX in their day-to-day online activities.\
    \ The Foundation recommends TronLink and TronWallet as their official community\
    \ developed wallet. You can also store and use your TRX in most other widely recognized\
    \ wallet brands such as Trust Wallet, Ledger, Cobo Wallet and others.\nCan I trade\
    \ TRX Derivatives?\nYes, there are various Tron derivative and futures markets.\
    \ Some examples include the TRXH20 and TRXM20 futures contract on BitMex. Check\
    \ out the full list of derivative products or derivative exchanges."

  description: 'What is TON?

    TON (The Open Network) is a Layer 1 smart contract network specializing in financial
    applications. It was first developed by Telegram’s co-founder Nikolai Durov known
    as “Telegram Open Network” but has been relaunched as “The Open Network” under
    the TON Foundation.

    How Does TON Work?

    TON was a Proof-of-Work blockchain before migrating to a Proof-of-Stake consensus
    algorithm. More specifically, it runs the BPoS (Block-Proof of stake) consensus
    algorithm, a Byzantine Fault-Tolerant variant of the PoS algorithm.

    TON consists of two major chains known as masterchains and workchains. Masterchains
    are the central coordinators of the networking managing validator nodes while
    workchains handle requests from smart contracts and dApps. On TON, workchains
    are split into multiple shards that each complete different tasks for more efficient
    transaction processing.

    Web3 Services on TON

    While TON specializes in financial applications, it also provides other services
    such as


    TON Storage is a decentralized file storage system based on peer-to-peer file-sharing
    technology. It allows users to upload and retrieve data globally with unique file
    IDs.

    TON Domain Name Service (DNS) converts TON wallet addresses to human-readable
    names

    TON Proxy securely and privately connects developers with applications on the
    blockchain. Users can also launch web servers on the TON blockchain via TON Sites.


    What is Toncoin?

    Toncoin (TON) is the native token of The Open Network, used for transaction fees,
    staking, and governance. It powers the TON ecosystem, with validators and stakers
    receiving TON rewards for protecting the network. It also has an on-chain governance
    platform for TON holders to submit improvement proposals.'

  description: 'What is Shiba Inu (SHIB)?

    Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a meme token which began as a fun currency and has now captured
    mainstream attention as a meme coin. What started of as a meme coin has attracted
    a decent following of developers who have built a decentralized ecosytem around
    the token, including a dedicated L2 chain Shibarium. During the initial launch,
    50% of the supply was allocated into Vitalik Buterin''s ethereum wallet. The price
    of SHIB has soared from as low as $0.000000000056 to an all time high of $0.000084,
    that is a 150,000 times increase within 8 months.

    As a result of that, Vitalik proceeded to donate 10% of his SHIB holdings to a
    COVID-19 relief effort in India and the remaining 40% is burnt forever. That donation
    was worth about $1 billion at that time, which makes it one of the largest donation
    ever in the world.


    What has the Shiba Inu community worked on?

    The Shiba Inu team launched a decentralized exchange called Shibaswap with 2 new
    tokens, LEASH and BONE. LEASH is a scarce supply token that is used to offer incentives
    on Shibaswap. BONE is the governance token for holders to vote on proposals on
    Doggy DAO. More recently, the team has also launched Shibarium, a dedicated L2
    chain surrounding the Shiba Inu (SHIB) token.'

  description: 'What is Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC)?

    Wrapped Bitcoin is an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain that represents
    Bitcoin. Each WBTC is backed 1:1 with Bitcoin. Wrapped Bitcoin allows for Bitcoin
    transfers to be conducted quicker on the Ethereum blockchain and opens up the
    possibility for BTC to be used in the Ethereum ecosystem. Bitcoin is held in custody
    by the centralized custodian, BitGo. Bitcoin can be converted to Wrapped Bitcoin
    and vice versa easily.

    How was Wrapped Bitcoin founded?

    WBTC was launched in January 2019. BitGo, Kyber Network and Ren collaborated to
    find a way for users to bring more liquidity into the Ethereum ecosystem and that’s
    how Wrapped Bitcoin was created. 

    What problem does WBTC solve?

    Most Decentralized Finance (DeFi) activities take place on the Ethereum blockchain
    and Bitcoin holders have no access to a wide selection of DeFi applications which
    includes features like lending, borrowing, trading and more. WBTC helps transfer
    the value of Bitcoin into the Ethereum blockchain so that users could start generating
    higher returns with their Bitcoin.

    Who are the key players in the WBTC ecosystem? 


    There are a few key players in the WBTC ecosystem. They are: 



    Custodian - Custodians are institutions that store crypto assets. In the case
    of WBTC, BitGo is responsible for custodying Bitcoin



    Merchant - Merchants play a key role in the distribution of WTBC by minting or
    burning WBTC



    Users - Users are holders of WBTC. Users can use WBTC to transfer and transact
    like any other ERC20 token in the Ethereum ecosystem



    WBTC DAO Member - WBTC DAO is the governing body that is responsible for contract
    changes and the addition/removal of custodian and merchant. This governance body
    helps decentralize the network via multisig contracts which requires all members
    to reach consensus before initiating a change. 



    How to convert BTC to WBTC?




    To convert BTC to WBTC, a user may visit any of the platforms that is labeled
    “Merchant” in the WBTC partners page.



    The user is required to verify his identity through a Know Your Customer (KYC)
    procedure. 



    After that, the user is required to transfer his BTC to the merchant’s BTC wallet.



    Once the merchant receives the BTC, the merchant will then notify the custodian,
    BitGo, the amount of WBTC to be minted.



    After obtaining 6 confirmations of the BTC transaction, the custodian will then
    produce an equivalent amount of WBTC.



    Finally, the WBTC will be sent to the user’s Ethereum wallet.



    How to convert WBTC to BTC?




    User initiates request to redeem BTC with WTBC.



    The merchant will create a burn transaction for the amount of WBTC to be redeemed.



    After 25 Ethereum block confirmations, the custodian will release an equivalent
    amount of BTC to the merchant’s Bitcoin address.



    Custodian makes an Ethereum transaction marking the burn request as completed.



    The user undergoes KYC procedure to redeem BTC.



    After that is done, the merchant will send BTC to the user’s BTC wallet address.



    How to keep track of WBTC?

    The conversion between WBTC and BTC is completed in a transparent manner. Users
    may refer to WBTC’s orderbook dashboard to see a record of all minting and burning
    of WBTC on the Ethereum network. Also, users can access WBTC’s proof of assets
    dashboard to view the transaction amount and the total amount of BTC held under
    custody. This system makes it easy for audits on a regular basis and it is a good
    method to maintain the trust of its users.

    What is the risk of using WBTC?

    Some of the biggest concerns of using WBTC is centralization and trust. All of
    the BTC backing WBTC are stored at BitGo, a centralized entity. BitGo is viewed
    as a central point of failure because it’s the only custodian overseeing WBTC
    at the moment. Also, users have to completely trust BitGo to safely store their
    BTC and honor the users’ redemption requests. 

    It is important to note that BitGo is one of the most reputable centralized custodian
    in the world and they have one of the most advanced coin security protocols in
    place. Not to forget, they are covered by digital asset insurance worth up to
    $100 million if anything bad were to occur.'

  description: 'What is Polkadot?

    Polkadot is a Layer-0 open-source blockchain platform and cryptocurrency that
    allows multiple blockchains to connect and operate within itself. It allows protocols
    and blockchain to share their unique features while pooling their security. In
    brief, Polkadot is a scalable heterogeneous multi-chain technology.

    Polkadot is heterogeneous because it is entirely flexible and makes no assumption
    about the nature or structure of the chains in the network. Even non-blockchain
    systems or data structures can become parachains if they fulfill a set of criteria.

    Polkadot may be considered equivalent to a set of independent chains (e.g. a set
    containing Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Namecoin, and Bitcoin) except with important
    additions: pooled security and trust-free interchain transactability.

    Who founded Polkadot?

    Gavin Wood, Robert Habermeier, and Peter Czaban founded Polkadot, Web3 Foundation''s
    flagship protocol. Wood is a prominent figure in the blockchain industry, having
    co-founded Ethereum and Solidity. Habermeier was a Thiel Fellow with a background
    in blockchains and cryptography, while Czaban brings experience in fintech.

    How does Polkadot work?

    Polkadot’s architecture includes a central Relay Chain with non-native blockchains
    running on top of the network called Parachains. The Relay Chain handles the network’s
    security, consensus, and interoperability, secured using a Nominated Proof-of-Stake
    (NPoS) consensus model. Many parachains are written using the Polkadot Runtime
    Environment SDK, which allows developers to create their own parachains to operate
    on the Polkadot network.

    There are many types of parachains each specialised for its own uses cases, such
    as:


    System parachains, which uses Polkadot’s native token, DOT

    Bridge parachains to connect to external network like Kusama, Polkadot’s Canary
    Network

    Smart contract parachains for hosting EVM dApps.


    Polkadot 2.0

    In Polkadot 2.0, Polkadot will migrate from a chain-focused ecosystem to an application-focused
    ecosystem. This means instead of owning an execution core at all times, each parachain
    will need to reserve and purchase blockspace based on their needs. The coretime
    marketplace model is expected to lower the entry barriers for developers.

    What is the DOT token?

    As Polkadot’s native token, DOT holders have governance rights to guide the operations
    of Polkadot DAO. They can also contribute to the network’s security through staking.
    New parachains are added by bidding DOT tokens through auctions. In the Polkadot
    2.0 update, DOT tokens can be used to buy coretime.'

  description: 'What is Chainlink?

    Chainlink is a framework for building Decentralized Oracle Networks (DONs) that
    bring real-world data onto blockchain networks, enabling the creation of hybrid
    smart contracts. These DONs provide decentralized services such as Price Feeds,
    Proof of Reserve, Verifiable Randomness, Keepers, and the ability to connect to
    any web API.

    It aims to ensure that the external information (pricing, weather data, event
    outcomes, etc.) and off-chain computations (randomness, transaction automation,
    fair ordering, etc.) fed to on-chain smart contracts are reliable and tamper-proof.


    Chainlink oracle networks are blockchain-agnostic and are incentivized through
    the native LINK token, used for node payments and network collateral.

    Watch a video to learn about Chainlink.

    A brief history of Chainlink

    Chainlink is an open-source protocol developed by Chainlink Labs (formerly Smart
    Contract Ltd.), founded in 2014 by Sergey Nazarov and Steve Ellis. 

    The Chainlink Network went live on the Ethereum mainnet on June 1st, 2019 and
    has since expanded to support additional blockchains and layer 2 networks such
    as Polygon, BSC, Avalanche, Arbitrum, and more.

    What is the purpose of Chainlink?

    To understand the purpose and function of Chainlink, we will split it into two
    sections:


    The Chainlink Network

    The Chainlink (LINK) token


    The Chainlink Network

    Before we dive into the function of the Chainlink Network, we need to understand
    the basics of smart contracts and how oracles work. 

    Smart contracts are programmatic code (if x event occurs, execute y action) that
    operate on a blockchain network. However, due to the security model of blockchain
    networks, smart contracts are isolated from the external world and cannot natively
    connect to off-chain systems. 

    To overcome this problem, an additional piece of infrastructure is required known
    as an “oracle” which relays data from the real world onto blockchain networks,
    where it can be consumed by smart contracts. 

    The Chainlink Network addresses this issue through Decentralized Oracle Networks
    (DONs) that consist of a network of independent oracle node operators that fetch,
    aggregate, validate, and deliver real-world data on-chain. Each oracle node can
    specialize in providing different decentralized services on the behalf of smart
    contracts.


    Chainlink DONs support two different ways of delivering off-chain data to on-chain
    smart contracts. This includes the basic request model and the decentralized data
    model. 


    Basic Request Model: Smart contracts generate and submit a data request to Chainlink
    oracle nodes in one transaction and receive the response later in time within
    a separate transaction.

    Decentralized Data Model: A shared data resource where Chainlink oracle nodes
    regularly update an on-chain reference contract with fresh data, allowing smart
    contracts to query and receive real-world data in a single transaction. 


    The decentralized data model is powered by Chainlink nodes using the Off-Chain
    Reporting Protocol (OCR), where data is fetched and aggregated off-chain, before
    a single transaction is submitted on-chain containing each node’s signature and
    corresponding data point. 

    The Chainlink Token (LINK)

    LINK is an ERC-677 token that is used to incentivize the proper operation of Chainlink
    DONs. The token has also been bridged across multiple blockchains to enable native
    Chainlink oracle integrations.

    The LINK token is used within the Chainlink Network for the following components: 


    Node Operators Fees: Smart contracts are required to pay Chainlink nodes using
    LINK tokens to obtain access to real-world data and other oracle services. 

    Implicit Staking: The current and future revenue of Chainlink nodes are denominated
    in LINK tokens, incentivizing the proper operation of the Chainlink Network.

    Explicit Staking: Chainlink nodes in the future can be required to lock up LINK
    tokens as collateral to back their oracle services, which can be slashed for malicious
    behavior. 


    Who uses Chainlink?

    The Chainlink Network is used by smart contract applications that require access
    to real-world data and off-chain computations. The network is also used by data
    providers to monetize their datasets by selling their APIs to smart contract applications.

    The most common use case includes securing Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols
    which require financial market data. The Chainlink Network offers a variety of
    on-chain data feeds that are used to secure tens of billions of dollars. Integrated
    applications include Aave, Compound, Synthetix, and more.'

  description: 'What is Bitcoin Cash?

    Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is a form of cryptocurrency much like Bitcoin. In fact, Bitcoin
    Cash was a fork of Bitcoin as a result of a chain split when a certain group of
    Bitcoin developers became dissatisfied with Bitcoin’s overall scalability direction.

    In November 2018, the Bitcoin Cash community would later further split into Bitcoin
    Cash and Bitcoin SV via another hard fork. The latter camp, supported by Craig
    Wright and Calvin Ayre proposed a competing software version called Bitcoin Satoshi
    Vision that would take the block size limit further to 128MB.

    On November 15th, 2020 the Bitcoin Cash experienced another hard fork. The forked
    occured on block #661647 have led to the launch of Bitcoin Cash ABC(BCHA). The
    Bitcoin Cash ABC network includes a miners'' tax where 8% of the mining rewards
    will be distributed to the BCHA developers as financing for protocol development.

    To sum it up simply, the Bitcoin Cash developers were originally dissatisfied
    with the decisions made in regards to Bitcoin’s development. Specifically, they
    were dissatisfied over the implementation of Segregated Witness (SegWit). The
    Bitcoin Cash developers believe that SegWit is a compromise to the decentralization
    of the Bitcoin network. They believed that the network could have increased its
    block size instead in order to allow Bitcoin to grow as a currency. Together,
    this group formed a plan to split from the Bitcoin blockchain and created Bitcoin
    Cash with a larger block capacity limit of 8 MB. Bitcoin went ahead with their
    plan to implement SegWit but the newly forked Bitcoin Cash did not implement SegWit.
    On 15 May 2018, the Bitcoin Cash block size limit was subsequently increased from
    8 MB to 32 MB.

    On 15 November 2018, Bitcoin Cash experienced a chain split from within its own
    community that resulted in the creation of Bitcoin SV. The creators of Bitcoin
    SV argued that Bitcoin Cash is no longer staying true to the original vision of
    the Bitcoin Whitepaper and decided to split off to form their own coin.

    How does Bitcoin Cash differ from Bitcoin?

    As Bitcoin Cash is a result of a chain split from Bitcoin, it shares much of Bitcoin’s
    fundamental workings. In fact, they even share the same history. 

    Due to it being a fork of bitcoin, all on-chain data prior to the split are inherited.
    If you owned 1 bitcoin before the creation of Bitcoin Cash, you now have 1 BTC
    and 1 BCH, which can both be signed using the same private keys.


    Source: Reddit r/btc

    However, Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash are not non-interoperable. You cannot send your
    Bitcoin Cash to the Bitcoin network and somehow own 2 BTC. Your bitcoin cash and
    bitcoin now exists on two different sets of blockchains.

    One of the main differences between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash is the block size
    limit and transaction fee. As Bitcoin Cash has bigger blocks and arguably lower
    usage, sending Bitcoin Cash on the network is relatively cheaper and faster than
    if done on Bitcoin. In that sense, Bitcoin Cash does serve as a faster and more
    efficient form of digital currency as extolled by Bitcoin Cash proponents.

    How do I store my Bitcoin Cash?

    If you are new to cryptocurrencies or are not careful with key management, it
    can be confusing to deal with Bitcoin Cash especially if you own Bitcoin and other
    Bitcoin-forks.

    Bitcoincash.org recommends a few wallets to use when storing your Bitcoin Cash.
    However, always do your own due diligence to select the best wallets that suit
    your needs.


    One way of mitigating risk is to use hardware wallets such as Trezor and Ledger.
    Hardware wallets are essentially external devices that look like USB memory sticks.
    A hardware wallet secures your private key that holds your Bitcoin into an external
    device outside of your personal computer so you do not need to worry if your computer
    is infected with malware. When you intend to transact, you simply connect the
    hardware wallet onto your personal computer and all the key signing would be done
    in the hardware itself.

    Another point to note is that you should always check the address which you intend
    to send your Bitcoin Cash to. Mistakenly sending your Bitcoin Cash to a Bitcoin
    or Bitcoin SV address will mean the loss of your coin entirely. 

    Who Created Bitcoin Cash?

    There are several prominent leaders behind Bitcoin Cash, one of them being Roger
    Ver.

    Can I Trade Bitcoin Cash Derivatives?

    Yes, if you are looking to enter a long or short Bitcoin Cash position, both perpetual
    swaps and futures are available for trading. Perpetual futures markets for Bitcoin
    Cash are available on various exchanges for you to trade.'

  description: 'What is WETH (Wrapped ETH)

    WETH is the tokenized/packaged form of ETH that you use to pay for items when
    you interact with Ethereum dApps. WETH follows the ERC-20 token standards, enabling
    it to achieve interoperability with other ERC-20 tokens. 

    This offers more utility to holders as they can use it across networks and dApps.
    You can stake, yield farm, lend, and provide liquidity to various liquidity pools
    with WETH. 

    Also, unlike ETH, which doesn’t conform to its own ERC-20 standard and thus has
    lower interoperability as it can’t be used on other chains besides Ethereum, WETH
    can be used on cheaper and high throughput alternatives like Binance, Polygon,
    Solana, and Cardano.

    The price of WETH will always be the same as ETH because it maintains a 1:1 wrapping
    ratio.

    How to Wrap ETH

    Custodians wrap and unwrap ETH. To wrap ETH, you send ETH to a custodian. This
    can be a multi-sig wallet, a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), or a
    smart contract. After connecting your web3 wallet to a DeFi exchange, you enter
    the amount of ETH you wish to wrap and click the swap function. Once the transaction
    is confirmed, you will receive WETH tokens equivalent to the ETH that you’ve swapped.

    On a centralized exchange, the exchange burns the deposited ETH and mints a wrapped
    form for you. And when you want to unwrap it, the exchange will burn the wrapped
    version and mint the ETH on your behalf.

    What’s Next for WETH

    According to the developers, hopefully there will be no future for WETH. According
    to the website, steps are being taken to update ETH to make it compliant with
    its own ERC-20 standards.

  description: 'What is UNI?

    UNI is the governance token for Uniswap. UNI was introduced on 16th September
    2020 through a retrospective airdrop to users who have interacted with the protocol
    either by swapping tokens or by providing liquidity.

    The UNI token allows token holders to participate in the governance of the protocol.
    Key decisions such as usage of the treasury or future upgrades can be decided
    through a governance vote.

    What is Uniswap?

    Uniswap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that makes it easy for users to swap
    an ERC-20 token for another ERC-20 token without the need of a centralized intermediary.
    With a DEX, traders do not have to deposit their tokens on an exchange and be
    exposed to the security risks of a centralized exchange. 

    Users just need an Ethereum wallet like Metamask and they can immediately start
    swapping tokens. Users can then swap tokens directly without the need of an orderbook.
    This works using an Automated Market Maker (AMM) where Liquidity Providers (LP)
    deposit tokens into the smart contract and this liquidity then provides a price
    quote to traders without relying on any professional market makers. Liquidity
    Providers are compensated with a 0.3% trading fee for providing liquidity on the
    protocol.


    When was Uniswap founded?

    The protocol was founded by Hayden Adams in 2018. Hayden was mainly inspired by
    the technology that was first described by Ethereum co-founder, Vitalik Buterin.

    What is an Automated Market Maker (AMM)?

    An AMM uses a pricing algorithm to price assets. Uniswap uses the “x*y = k” formula
    to price its assets. Within the formula, x represents the amount of one token
    in the liquidity pool, y is the amount of the other asset and k is a fixed constant.
    In Uniswap, the value of both assets constantly remains at a ratio of 50:50.

    Uniswap popularized the AMM model and other crypto protocols started utilizing
    the AMM due to its innovative and decentralized features. However, one of the
    biggest setbacks for the AMM model is impermanent loss.

    Impermanent loss is the opportunity cost of contributing two crypto assets into
    a liquidity pool instead of holding the two crypto assets separately outside the
    liquidity pool. Impermanent loss occurs when the price of one token rises or falls
    relative to the other. The larger the change, the larger the impermanent loss
    will be.

    What is UNI’s Price Prediction?

    Currently, the 0.3% trading fees do not accrue to UNI token holders - all trading
    fees currently only accrue to Liquidity Providers. With the protocol doing over
    $1 billion of daily trading volume, experts are speculating that the price of
    UNI will be based on the potential return made through fees, should at some point
    governance decide to enable that.'

  description: 'What is Litecoin?

    Litecoin is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency created by Charlie Lee. It was created
    based on the Bitcoin protocol but differs in terms of the hashing algorithm used
    and its max supply. Litecoin uses the memory intensive Scrypt proof of work mining
    algorithm. Scrypt allows consumer-grade hardware such as GPU to mine those coins.
    There will be 84 million Litecoins that can ever be mined, which is 4 times more
    than Bitcoin''s max supply.

    What makes Litecoin unique?

    Litecoin is a cryptocurrency that has evolved from Bitcoin after its own popularity
    in the industry, this alternative, or ‘altcoin’ has emerged to allow investors
    to diversify their digital currency package, according to Investopedia.

    Litecoin is one of the most prominent altcoins and was created by former Google
    employee and Director of Engineering at Coinbase, Charlie Lee. Litecoin was the
    first to alter Bitcoin and the most significant difference is that it takes 2.5
    minutes for Litecoin to generate a block, or transaction, in comparison to Bitcoin''s
    10 minutes.

    ‘While this matters little to traders, miners who use hardware to run Bitcoin''s
    network cannot switch over to Litecoin. This keeps bigger mining conglomerates
    away from Litecoin because they cannot easily optimize their profits by swapping
    to another coin, contributing to a more decentralized experience. Litecoin also
    has bigger blocks, and more coins in circulation, making it more affordable and
    swift when transacting,’ Investopedia explained.

    As explained above, Litecoin can transact a lot faster than Bitcoin, but there
    are also a number of other characteristics that investors need to know before
    trading. Litecoin can handle higher volumes of transactions because of the capability
    of transacting faster and if Bitcoin attempted to transact on the scale of its
    altcoin, a code update would be needed. However, Litecoin’s blocks would be larger,
    but with more ‘orphaned blocks''. The faster block time of litecoin reduces the
    risk of double spending attacks - this is theoretical in the case of both networks
    having the same hashing power.

    What are the technical differences for Litecoin?

    The transaction confirmation time taken for Litecoin is about 2.5 minutes on average
    (as compared to Bitcoin''s 10 minutes). The Litecoin network is scheduled to cap
    at 84 million currency units. 

    Litecoin has inspired many other popular alternative currencies (eg. Dogecoin)
    because of its Scrypt hashing algorithm in order to prevent ASIC miners from mining
    those coins. However it is said that by the end of this year, Scrypt ASIC will
    enter the mass market.'

  description: 'What is the Internet Computer and ICP?

    The Internet Computer blockchain incorporates a radical rethink of blockchain
    design, powered by innovations in cryptography. It provides the first “World Computer”
    blockchain that can be used to build almost any Web 2.0 online system or service,
    and web3 services, including web3 social media services, without any need for
    centralized traditional IT such as cloud computing services. It also enables smart
    contracts it hosts to directly create transactions on other blockchains, which
    in turn enables the full end-to-end decentralization of online services and web3
    for the first time.

    Who founded the Internet Computer?

    The project was founded in October 2016 by Dominic Willams and has raised a total
    of $121 million from investors such as Adreessen Horowitz, Polychain Capital,
    Multicoin Capital and such. On May 10, 2021, DFINITY launched the Internet Computer
    into the public domain, marking it a major milestone for ICP as it means the internet
    now functions as a decentralized global computer. This is marked by the release
    of all of the Internet Computer’s source code into the public domain, as well
    as the ICP utility token that allows tens of thousands of community members to
    govern the Internet Computer network.

    Internet Computer-based Projects

    1. DeFi

    Next-generation decentralized exchanges such as Sonic, InfinitySwap, and ICPSwap,
    running entirely on-chain, are leveraging the Internet Computer’s reverse-gas
    model and 1 second transaction finality to give users zero gas fees and lightning
    fast speed for swaps, transactions, and more.

    2. NFT

    The lead artist behind the Bored Ape Yacht Club collection, debuted a new collection
    of NFTs on the Internet Computer at Art Basel, “The new series is hosted on the
    Internet Computer allowing for bigger file sizes. It''s an example of how artists
    are starting to experiment with NFT platforms beyond Ethereum.” ORIGYN, a NFT
    marketplace building on the Internet Computer, saw its valuation soar to $300
    million following a round of investment from Paris Hilton and Wall Street veteran
    Bill Ackman.

    3. Games

    MetaSports Basketball is an open basketball metaverse, where users utilize their
    favorite Ethereum and Internet Computer-based NFTs to compete to become basketball
    superstars on teams they own and manage. 

    4. Social media



    OpenChat boasts 100,000 users, with close to 1 million messages sent over its
    decentralized messaging service. 



    Distrikt, a decentralized Facebook, surpassed 70,000 user accounts and 100,000
    posts — with less than $100 spent on gas. 



    Dmail is the Web3 replacement for email, and enables users to send and receive
    blockchain-backed, encrypted messages. 



    DSocial is a decentralized version of YouTube, enabling content creators to be
    fairly rewarded via tokens for their work, and engagement.



    5. Metaverse



    PokedStudios launched the Bots NFT collection in an early foray into the metaverse
    on the Internet Computer, with the rarest Bot netting a sale of 3,000 ICP (~$172,140). 



    IC Gallery is an interoperable 3D metaverse blending GameFi and DeFi, where users
    can play, mint, and trade all their existing NFTs through various immersive 3D

  description: 'What is Bittensor?

    Bittensor is an open-source protocol that utilizes blockchain technology to create
    a decentralized machine learning network. This network enables machine learning
    models to train collaboratively and be rewarded in TAO according to the informational
    value they offer the collective. Additionally, Bittensor''s TAO grants external
    access to users, allowing them to extract information from the network while tuning
    its activities to meet their needs. The ultimate vision of Bittensor is to create
    a market for artificial intelligence, allowing producers and consumers of this
    commodity to interact in a trustless, open, and transparent context. Bittensor
    provides a novel strategy for developing and distributing artificial intelligence
    technology, promoting open access/ownership, decentralized governance, and global
    access to computing power and innovation within an incentivized framework. The
    Bittensor network operates using two types of nodes, servers and validators, with
    assessments based on the value of their responses. Nodes that add value to the
    network are rewarded with more stake (TAO), while low-value nodes are weakened
    and eventually de-registered.'

  description: 'What is Kaspa (KAS)?

    Kaspa is a proof-of-work cryptocurrency that implements the GHOSTDAG protocol.
    Unlike traditional blockchains, GHOSTDAG does not orphan blocks created in parallel.
    Instead, GHOSTDAG allows them to coexist and orders them in consensus.

    This generalization of Nakamoto consensus allows for secure operation while maintaining
    very high block rates (currently one block per second, aiming for 10/sec, dreaming
    of 100/sec) and minuscule confirmation times dominated by internet latency (cf.
    chapter 6 of the paper for some initial benchmarks).

    The Kaspa implementation includes a lot of new features and subprotocols including
    Reachability to query the DAG''s topology, Block data pruning (with near-future
    plans for block header pruning), SPV proofs, and later subnetwork support which
    will make future implementation of layer 2 solutions much easier.'

  description: 'What is Arbitrum?

    Arbitrum is a rollup chain designed to improve the scalability of Ethereum. It
    achieves this by bundling multiple transactions into a single transaction, thereby
    reducing the load on the Ethereum network.

    In simple terms, a rollup chain is a layer 2 solution that aggregates and processes
    transactions off-chain, before submitting a single transaction to the Ethereum
    mainnet. This means that users can enjoy faster and cheaper transactions, while
    still benefiting from the security and decentralization of the Ethereum network.

    Arbitrum''s native token is called the Arbitrum token, or ARB for short. The token
    is used to pay for transaction fees on the Arbitrum network and also serves as
    a means of governance for the protocol. Holders of ARB can participate in decision-making
    processes, such as proposing and voting on protocol upgrades or changes.

    Arbitrum is a rollup chain that enables faster and cheaper transactions on Ethereum,
    while its native token ARB is used for transaction fees and governance. With the
    increasing demand for Ethereum-based applications and transactions, rollup chains
    like Arbitrum are becoming increasingly important for improving the scalability
    of the network.

    What is happening with Arbitrum Airdrop?

    Arbitrum is conducting an airdrop of its native token, ARB, to users who have
    previously used certain Ethereum-based applications. This is being done to incentivize
    users to try out the Arbitrum network and to increase adoption of the protocol.

    To be eligible for the airdrop, users must meet a number of the following criteria:


    Have bridged into Arbitrum One.

    Have bridged into Arbitrum Nova.

    Have conducted transactions over a course a few distinct months.

    Have conducted a number of different transactions with different smart contracts.

    Have conducted transactions with over a certain value in dollars cumulatively
    in aggregate value


    You can check if you''ve been eligible for ARB token airdrop in the Arbitrum Foundation

  description: 'What is Vechain?

    VeChain (VET) is a versatile enterprise-grade L1 smart contract platform.

    VeChain began in 2015 as a private consortium chain, working with a host of enterprises
    to explore applications of blockchain. VeChain would begin their transition to
    public blockchain in 2017 with the ERC-20 token VEN, before launching a mainnet
    of their own in 2018 using the ticker VET.

    VeChain aims to use distributed governance and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies
    to create an ecosystem which solves major data hurdles for multiple global industries
    from medical to energy, food & beverage to sustainability and SDG goals. By leveraging
    the power of trustless data, VeChain is building the digital backbone that will
    underpin the fourth industrial revolution, which demands real-time and trustless
    data sharing between many participants.

    The platform uses two tokens, VET and VTHO, to manage and create value based on
    its VeChainThor public blockchain. VET generates VTHO and acts as the store of
    value and value transfer medium. VTHO is used to pay for GAS costs, separating
    the need to expend VET when writing data. This has the additional benefit of ensuring
    costs of using the network can be kept stable by tweaking certain variables such
    as the amount of VTHO required to service a transaction, or by increasing the
    VTHO generation rate. Such actions first require all-stakeholder community votes.

    VeChain has been able to demonstrate massively boosted efficiency, traceability
    and transparency across data trails, supply chains and within novel kinds of ecosystems,
    such as those in San Marino targeting UN SDGs, among others.

    Vechain Foundation

    There is also the VeChain Foundation. The Vechain Foundation is a non - profit
    entity established in Singapore in July 2017 and is responsible for the construction
    of the network, and technological research and development. The Foundation also
    plays an important role in business development. The Foundation encourages and
    supports partnerships with enterprises that may be interested in utilizing blockchain
    technology as a service. This includes payment services, private key management,
    smart contract development, and wallet development. There is no doubt that blockchain
    technology can be an important innovation to supply chain management. With a growing
    list of business partnerships and technological developments, VeChain is positioning
    itself to be THE disruptive, and innovative force that reshapes the way we think
    about supply chain management.

    VeChain team

    Sunny Lu is the CEO of the VeChain Foundation and has already become an important
    figure in the blockchain space. Before he established VeChain, he co-founded the
    Chinese Internet start-up which developed Qtum, a very important digital asset
    in the crypto space. He was previously the CIO and COO of Louis Vuitton China.The
    team behind VeChain consists of over 90+ employees, most of them being developers.
    Chief Technology Officer, Gu Jianliang, has over 18 years of experience in areas
    such as mobile devices and the IoT field, and has created over a 100 patents in
    several technological fields. Kevin Feng serves as the Chief Operations Officer
    of the VeChain Foundation. Feng has been actively involved in many technology
    projects in his 12 years working for VeChain’s partner, PWC, as a consultant and
    assurance advisor.'

  description: 'What is Dai?

    Dai is a stablecoin issued by Maker Protocol. Its first stablecoin iteration was
    known as the Single Collateral Dai (SAI), which used Ether (ETH) as collateral. 

    Two years later in 2019, the Foundation released the Multi-Collateral Dai (DAI),
    phasing out SAI. The platform has enjoyed widespread adoption and is the largest
    decentralized lending platform with around $2.58 billion in total value locked
    (TVL), as of December 2020.

    What can Dai (DAI) do?

    Dai has several strong benefits and use cases. Most notably, Dai’s soft peg to
    the US Dollar helps mitigate price volatility. In the cryptocurrency space where
    price swings are common and dramatic, this feature helps preserve Dai’s value
    and promotes its use as a medium of exchange. 

    Additionally, the stablecoin’s decentralized nature means that it is highly composable
    with other decentralized applications (Dapps) such as Compound, Uniswap etc. It
    also provides greater transparency and censorship resistance compared to centralized
    solutions. 

    The source code for the protocol can be viewed freely by anyone who wishes to
    do so. Dai holders can also save their Dai and earn interest through the Dai Savings
    Rate (DSR) mechanism. Further reading on Dai’s benefits and use cases can be found
    in Maker’s whitepaper and ecosystem page. 

    What cryptocurrencies can I use as collateral?

    Maker provides a list of cryptocurrency assets that can be used as collateral
    on Oasis’ borrow tab. As of December 2020, there are 16 supported assets, each
    with their own differing collateralization ratios and stability fees. The addition
    of new collateral assets, as well as the determination of collateralization ratios
    and stability fees, are decided through voting on Maker’s governance platform. 

    How does Dai work?


    In principle, Dai is similar to a loan or mortgage. In traditional finance, these
    credit facilities are obtained from financial institutions upon fulfilling several
    stringent requirements such as the provision of sufficient collateral, robust
    credit scores and compliance with KYC and criminal background checks. The key
    differences with Dai however, is that only collateral in the form of cryptocurrencies
    is needed, and Dai loans are issued in a decentralized manner via smart contracts. 

    The stablecoin’s soft peg to the US Dollar is also another distinguishing feature,
    maintained through supply and demand auctions, the Dai Savings Rate (DSR) and
    Stability Fees. For instance, if Dai >$1, users would be incentivized to mint
    more Dai and lock-in additional collateral. The minting of more Dai will increase
    its supply and thus, bring Dai’s value back to its target price. 

    The DSR and Stability Fees can also be altered to incentivize less/more Dai given
    if prices remain sticky. The inner workings of Dai’s soft peg can be read on its
    auction documentation here, as well as briefly in the whitepaper.'

  description: 'What is Filecoin?

    Filecoin is a decentralized storage network based on the Interplanetary File Storage
    (IPFS) protocol. It is designed to utilized unused storage globally into an efficient
    storage market for users to pay for low cost storage. The objective is to ensure
    file storage is permanent and distributed across the web. Contrast this with centralized
    cloud storage solution such as Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, or Dropbox,
    where data are stored in servers owned by these private corporations.

    Filecoin (FIL or ⨎) is also the currency of the decentralized storage network.
    Customers wanting to access storage will have to pay for storage in Filecoin.
    Nodes that provide storage to the network will in turn be paid in Filecoin for
    their service.


    What is IPFS?

    IPFS stands for Interplanetary File Storage, a peer-to-peer storage and file system
    protocol developed by Protocol Labs. When a file is uploaded to the IPFS network,
    the file is designated a unique signature, and multiple nodes can host a whole
    or portion of that file. These files can be requested by any user with access
    to the address through the unique signature. As any nodes can store a copy of
    the file, it is distributed thus giving resilience to the file''s existence on
    the internet. Many haven liken IPFS to be as important as the Bittorrent protocol
    created by Bram Cohen.

    What was Filecoin ICO price?

    The Filecoin initial coin offering (ICO) price started at $1, and increased by
    $1 for every $40 million raised, capping at $6 per token. The ICO was conducted
    on August 10th, 2017 and the Filecoin team have successfully raised over $200 million
    of funding.

    Who are the founders of Filecoin?

    Protocol Labs is the company behind Filecoin founded by Juan Benet. 

    Is Filecoin on Ethereum?

    No, Filecoin has its own blockchain network, specialized at network storage.

    Is Filecoin live?

    Yes, Filecoin is already running live on mainnet which was launched on October
    15th, 2020

    Who are the competitors of Filecoin?

    There are other storage network that is also providing distributed file storage
    incentivized with cryptocurrencies such as Storj, Siacoin, BitTorrent, Arweave,
    and other storage sector coins.'

  description: 'What is Cosmos Hub (ATOM)?

    The Cosmos network consists of many independent, parallel blockchains, called
    zones, each powered by classical Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus protocols
    like Tendermint (already used by platforms like ErisDB). Some zones act as hubs
    with respect to other zones, allowing many zones to interoperate through a shared
    hub.

    The architecture is a more general application of the Bitcoin sidechains concept,
    using classic BFT and Proof-of-Stake algorithms, instead of Proof-of-Work.Cosmos
    can interoperate with multiple other applications and cryptocurrencies, something
    other blockchains can’t do well. By creating a new zone, you can plug any blockchain
    system into the Cosmos hub and pass tokens back and forth between those zones,
    without the need for an intermediary.

    While the Cosmos Hub is a multi-asset distributed ledger, there is a special native
    token called the atom. Atoms have three use cases: as a spam-prevention mechanism,
    as staking tokens, and as a voting mechanism in governance.

    As a spam prevention mechanism, Atoms are used to pay fees. The fee may be proportional
    to the amount of computation required by the transaction, similar to Ethereum’s
    concept of “gas”. Fee distribution is done in-protocol and a protocol specification
    is described here.

    As staking tokens, Atoms can be “bonded” in order to earn block rewards. The economic
    security of the Cosmos Hub is a function of the amount of Atoms staked. The more
    Atoms that are collateralized, the more “skin” there is at stake and the higher
    the cost of attacking the network. Thus, the more Atoms there are bonded, the
    greater the economic security of the network.

    Atom holders may govern the Cosmos Hub by voting on proposals with their staked
    Atoms.

  description: 'What is Aave?

    Aave is a decentralized money market protocol where users can lend and borrow
    cryptocurrency across 20 different assets as collateral.

    The protocol has a native token called AAVE, which is also a governance token
    that lets the community decide the direction of the protocol in a collective manner.

    Lenders can earn interest by providing liquidity to the market, while borrowers
    can borrow by collateralizing their cryptoassets to take out loans from the liquidity
    pools.

    What is the origin and history of Aave?


    Aave was previously known as ETHLend when it was founded in November 2017 by Stani
    Kulechov and has successfully raised $16.2 million through an ICO round. ETHLend
    was then rebranded to Aave in September 2018.

    Its native token, Aave (AAVE), was launched in October 2020 as one of Aave’s initiatives
    to become self-governed. Following the token’s launch, a 1:100 token migration
    must be made from the old token.

    At the moment, Aave has integrated, partnered, and collaborated with 30 companies,
    notably Curve,1inch, and Synthetix. You can find out more information here:https://aave.com/ecosystem/.

    Fun fact: Aave is a Finnish word translated to “ghost” in English, which illustrates
    the protocol’s goal to be transparent and an open infrastructure in DeFi.

    Who is the founder of Aave?

    At the time of writing, the Aave team is made up of 29 individuals with Stani
    Kulechov as the CEO.

    How does the protocol works?

    Users who use the Aave platform can utilize the lending and borrowing functionality
    across 20 supported cryptocurrencies such as Dai (DAI), Uni (UNI), and Yearn.Finance
    (YFI)

    Lenders can earn interest by providing liquidity in the market. There will be
    two sources of earnings by providing liquidity: (1) the interest rate paid on
    loans and (2) a percentage of flash loan fees.

    Borrowers could opt for the loan to be on a fixed or variable rate, whichever
    is the best for them.

    In the latest v2 release, users can protect themselves from liquidation by swapping
    their collateral with a different asset.

    Lastly, Aave’s main unique product is a “flash loan” where borrowers can take
    up the loan with zero collateralization. However, the borrower must pay back the
    loan and any additional interest, plus the fees within the same transaction.

    What is the AAVE token?

    The token has 3 primary roles within the platform:



    Governance



    Incentives



    Mitigation tool



    How is the token used for governance?

    AAVE can be used to vote and decide on the protocol’s upgrade via Aave Improvement
    Proposals (AIPs).


    (Image source: https://docs.aave.com/aavenomics/governance)

    How is the token used as an incentive?

    AAVE can be staked within the protocol, and the users can earn the protocol’s
    staking rewards and fees. There are two ways to stake: (1) Stake AAVE and earn
    rewards in AAVE or (2) Stake Balancer Pool Token (BPT) and earn AAVE, BAL, and
    trading fees from Balancer. 

    How is the token used as a mitigation tool?

    In the event of associated shortfalls, the staked AAVE will act as insurance to
    cover the deficit. For example, your staked assets will be slashed up to 30% when
    Aave protocol is in a deficit state for the liquidity providers.

    Who has audited Aave?

    Since 2019, Aave has been audited 13 times and they were done by Trail of Bits,
    Open Zeppelin, Consensys Diligence, Certik, Peckshield, and Certora. 

    Is there a difference between Version 1 and Version 2?

    Aave’s second iteration has introduced several interesting new features.

    One of the notable ones is the collateral swap feature. This allows users to swap
    their collateral to another supported asset at any given time. It is a great feature,
    especially for those who want to avoid liquidation.

    Another feature is loan repayment with collateral, enabling the borrowers to close
    their loan positions by paying directly with their collateral in just one transaction.

    Do I need to do anything to migrate from Version 1 to Version 2?

    Aave v2 is just a protocol upgrade and its native token won’t be affected by the
    changes. Hence, if you are holding AAVE, you do not need to do anything.

    Additionally, if you have loan positions on Aave v1, you do not need to close
    them either. Aave released a migration tool to help you migrate your positions.
    To know more on how to migrate your loan positions, kindly refer to this blog
    post.

    Can I long or short Aave?

    Yes, you can long or short Aave via perpetual swap or futures such as Binance
    Futures, and OKX These derivative exchanges are not formally regulated and can
    provide even up to 125x leverage. Derivative contracts are high-risk products,
    and you might want to understand what you are doing before participating in them.'

  description: 'What is Fantom?

    Fantom is a Layer 1, EVM-compatible blockchain. It aimed to create a secure and
    efficient smart contract platform for projects to develop decentralized applications
    (dApps) and execute peer-to-peer financial transactions.

    What Makes Fantom Unique?

    Fantom stands out with its Lachesis consensus mechanism for fast and scalable
    transactions. Unlike most blockchains, which require a set number of blocks added
    to the chain to validate a transaction, transactions on Fantom are validated as
    soon as over two-thirds of the node reaches a uniform response. It allows Fantom
    to achieve almost instant transactions.

    What can FTM Be Used For?

    FTM tokens power the Fantom ecosystem. Fantom runs a Proof-of-Stake consensus
    algorithm, so holders can stake their FTM tokens to secure the network and receive
    rewards. FTM stakers can vote on proposals to improve the platform. And finally,
    FTM is used to cover gas fees for native transactions.'

  description: 'What is Monero (XMR)?

    Monero (XMR) is the top privacy-centric cryptocurrency based on the CryptoNote
    protocol, a secure, private and untraceable currency system. Monero uses a special
    kind of cryptography to ensure that all of its transactions are  remain 100% unlinkable
    and untraceable. In an increasingly transparent world, you can see why something
    like Monero can become so desirable.

    Origins of Monero (XMR)

    In July of 2012, Bytecoin, the first real life implementation of CryptoNote, was
    launched. While Bytecoin had promise, people noticed that 80% of the coins were
    already published. So, it was decided that the bytecoin blockchain will be forked
    and the new coins in the new chain will be called Bitmonero, which is was then
    renamed Monero, meaning “coin” in Esperanto language. In this new blockchain,
    a block will be mined and added every two minutes.

    Why Monero (XMR)?

    #1: Unlinkability - Your identity is completely private You have complete control
    over your transactions. You are responsible for your money. Because your identity
    is private no one will be able to see what you are spending your money on. When
    you send funds to someone’s public address, what happens is that you actually
    send the funds to a randomly created brand new one-time destination address. 
    This means that the public record does not contain any mention that funds were
    received to the recipient’s public address. In Monero, your public address will
    never appear in the public record of transactions. Instead, a ''stealth address''
    is recorded in a way that only you, the recipient, can recognize the incoming
    funds.

    #2: Fungibility Fungibility is interchangeability between one asset and another
    asset of the same type. Suppose you borrowed $50 from your friend, you can even
    return the money in the form of 1 $50 bill or 5 $10 bill, It is still fine. This
    shows that the dollar has fungible properties. However, if you were to borrow
    someone’s car for the weekend and come back and give them some other car in return,
    then that person will probably punch on the face. Cars, in this example, are a
    nonfungible asset.

    What is CryptoNote?

    CryptoNote is the application layer protocol that fuels various decentralized
    currencies. While it is similar to the application layer which runs bitcoin in
    many aspects, there a lot of areas where the two differ from each other. CryptoNote
    features an entirely new code base and is not a fork of Bitcoin. More info about
    CryptoNote can be found at their website. 

    CryptoNote uses Ring Signatures to conceal sender identities via mixing and it
    also has unlinkable transactions that is achieved using 1-time keys for each individual
    payments. Ring signatures enable ‘transaction mixing’ to occur. Transaction mixing
    means that when funds are sent, the sender randomly chooses several other users’
    funds to also appear in the transaction as a possible source of the funds being
    sent. 

    The cryptographical nature of the ring signature means that no one can tell which
    of the funds were really the source of the transaction – not even the person that
    gave the funds to the sender in the first place. A system of ‘key images’ associated
    with each ring signature ensures that although no one can tell the true source
    of the funds, it can be easily detected if the sender attempts to anonymously
    send their funds twice.'

  description: 'What is The Graph?

    It is an indexing protocol and a global API aimed at organizing blockchain data,
    while making it easily accessible via GraphQL. Developers can use Graph Explorer
    to search, find, and publish all the public data they need to build decentralized
    applications. This makes it possible for developers build serverless dApps that
    run entirely on public infrastructures.

    Who are the founders?

    It was founded by Yaniv Tal (Project Lead), Jannis Pohlman (Tech Lead), and Brandom
    Ramirez (Research Lead)

    Who are the investors?

    They closed a $5 million private token sale funded by Coinbase Ventures, Framework
    Ventures, Digital Currency Group, and more; while also did a $2.5 million seed
    round led by Multicoin Capital. A public sale round of $12 million was also concluded
    few months before the launch of mainnet.


    How does the protocol work?

    Developers can define a subgraph which specifies how blockchain data are structured
    to be consumed by app and dapp developers. App and dapp developers can query the network
    using subgraph schemas with GraphQL which are paid in GRT tokens.

    These data are served by indexers who act as nodes, incentivized with GRT tokens
    to ensure that the API is always available in a decentralized manner and data
    are served correctly.

    As there can be many subgraphs out there, curators are tasked to find the subgraphs
    that are most useful to developers. Curators are also incentivized with GRT tokens
    to find the best subgraph that others would find useful.

    Who are its users?

    Developers are able to obtain most of the essential Ethereum data through The
    Graph which includes data for Uniswap, Balancer, Curve, Aave, Moloch DAO, Compound,
    and more.

    Apps and dapps that are using The Graph includes CoinGecko, Uniswap Info, Decentraland,
    Synthetix, Aragon, and more.

    The service have also recently expanded to offer data from other blockchains such
    as Binance Smart Chain, Bitcoin, Cosmos, Avalanche, Flow, Polygon POS, Arbitrum,
    Celo, and more.

    What is the GRT token?

    GRT coin is the native token of the network that’s used to coordinate work. Node
    operators (called Indexers) can stake and earn GRT for processing queries. Anyone
    can delegate their tokens to indexers to secure the network and earn rewards.
    Curators organize data on The Graph by signaling GRT on useful APIs, called subgraphs.
    Indexers, Delegators, and Curators work together to organize the data for the
    crypto economy and maintain a useful global API for DeFi and Web3.'

  description: 'What is Theta Network?


    Theta network is a decentralized video streaming network that is powered by blockchain
    technology. Theta allows users to watch video content and get rewarded with tokens
    as they share their internet bandwidth and computing resources on a peer-to-peer
    (P2P) basis. Besides a line-up of institutional investors like Node Capital and
    DHVC, Theta Network is advised by Steve Chen, co-founder of YouTube, and Justin
    Kan, co-founder of Twitch.

    How does THETA work?


    The video streaming services on Theta rely on a distributed network of users who
    voluntarily contribute their spare bandwidth and computing resources to run Theta’s
    system, in return for Theta Fuel (TFuel) reward.

    Theta runs on a modified proof-of-stake consensus mechanism as it has a unique
    multi-Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) which combines a committee of 20-30 Validator
    nodes with a second later of thousands of Guardian nodes. This acts to speed up
    approvals and is faster than traditional proof-of-work networks. Theta’s multi-BFT
    design achieves a healthy balance between consistency, speed, and decentralization.

    With this architecture in place, Theta’s Network’s content storage and delivery
    capabilities are powered by Theta Edge Nodes. Besides the Validator and Guardian
    nodes, community members of Theta also operate the Theta Edge Nodes, which make
    up the Theta Edge Network that is fully decentralized for data delivery and edge
    computing. Crucially, edge nodes allow users to capture live video, transcode
    and relay video content as well as share bandwidth across the network globally
    without the need for centralised servers. As of April 2021, the edge network has
    as many as 30,000 nodes, if not more; making it the backbone for Theta’s P2P content-sharing
    ecosystem.

    In addition, Theta can support Turing-complete smart contracts. These smart contracts
    open a new avenue for various user experiences, as more DApps are built on the
    Theta network. Subsequently, Theta launched the Theta Token Minter which allows
    any user to create new TNT-20 tokens on the Theta blockchain with no smart contract
    experience required – meaning users can input token name, ticker symbol, and supply
    parameters of their new token and the Token Minter will mint the new tokens. This
    seamless and non-technical way to mint tokens on the Theta blockchain invites
    a wide range of DApps and assets that can be built on the protocol.


    Theta Network operates on a dual token design:

    THETA is the native token for Theta Network that serves multiple governance tasks.
    THETA is used to stake as a Validator or Guardian node. Its Validator notes are
    run by Google, Blockchain Ventures, Samsung, Sony Europe and Binance, along with
    a network of community-run Guardian nodes. By staking and operating a node, users
    earn a proportional amount of new Theta Fuel.

    Theta Fuel (TFUEL) is the operational token of the Theta protocol. TFUEL is used
    for on-chain transactions such as rewarding Edge Nodes relayers for sharing video
    content, or for interacting with smart contracts. So, TFUEL can be earned by relayers
    of the Edge network for every video stream they relay to other users on the p2p
    network.

    Why was this project started?


    Theta aims to provide blockchain-enabled solutions to issues, such as poor quality
    and inefficient bottlenecks, faced by the traditional video streaming system.
     Currently, most centralized video streaming platforms suffer from poor infrastructure
    and high costs that result in poor user experience. In turn, content creators
    earn less due to barriers such as these between them and end users.  The team
    at Theta Network aims to disrupt the traditional video streaming industry in its
    current centralized form and rely on a distributed network of users whose contributions
    are rewarded.'

  description: 'What is ThorChain?

    ThorChain is a decentralized liquidity network with an interoperable blockchain
    that allows cross-chain token swaps in a non-custodial manner. It does not peg
    or wrap assets, but simply allows users to swap tokens across various Layer 1
    blockchains. So, traders on ThorChain can seamlessly move from Bitcoin to Ethereum,
    to Polkadot and etc. without having to register for an exchange or go through
    KYC, like on CEXs. Hence, users are minimally exposed to custody and counterparty
    risks. 

    What is RUNE?

    ThorChain’s consensus is proof-of-stake and built on Tendermint (Cosmos), with
    network validators (nodes) required to bond their native token, RUNE. RUNE has
    a token model that increases in value as the utilization of the network grows.
    This means that the more liquidity is deposited into ThorChain liquidity pools,
    the more valuable RUNE gets. 

    RUNE is needed for two fundamental reasons: 

    (i) In liquidity pools, it acts as a base pair so a 1:1 ratio of ASSET:RUNE is
    required (e.g. BNB.RUNE, ETH.RUNE). This is because ThorChain does not actually
    operate by direct asset transfer, it needs RUNE to move from one asset into another
    and to activate ThorChain’s Bifrost Protocol. This protocol is the bridge that
    enables multichain connectivity within ThorChain and requires RUNE to operate. 

    (ii) RUNE is bonded as collateral by nodes for security sake following a 2:1 bond:stake
    ratio. Thus, RUNE is not intended to be a governance token. ThorChain will be
    governed more like Bitcoin, where nodes running can determine what direction it
    takes. This also means that ThorChain is not only limited to traders looking to
    trade spot tokens. It is also intended to be used by liquidity providers and node
    operators.

    Therefore, with a 2:1 bond:stake ratio, combined with the 1:1 pool stake ratio,
    the amount of RUNE needed in the work is thus three times the amount of the non-RUNE
    assets locked. This 3:1 ratio is just the minimum value of RUNE. 

    RUNE serves these five purposes

    1. Liquidity: as a settlement asset 

    2. Security: As a sybil-resistant security measure and a mean for driving economic
    behaviour 

    3. Governance: To signal priority on-chain

    4. Incentive: as part of incentive mechanism, RUNE is used to pay out rewards,
    charge fees and subsidize gas

    5. Amplifier: to elevate assets that are on ThorChain

    Users who utilize ThorChain’s cross-chain services between the pools will need
    to pay fixed network fees as well as a variable slip fee. The fee is paid due
    to gas fees on external services and for fast execution. Besides offering a seamless
    service to traders, users can also become liquidity providers on ThorChain.

    Liquidity providers on ThorChain can add liquidity to various pools, which are
    then tied to RUNE in a separate vault. The project’s Continuous Liquidity Pool
    (CLP) incentivises any ThorChain participant to supply liquidity in exchange for
    a reward. The CLP is one of the cornerstone concepts driving the project, mainly
    because it is an economic paradigm that is a solution to liquidity shortage issues
    faced by most exchanges. ThorChain’s CLP has its own on-chain and trustless ‘basket’
    of liquidity and incentivising participation in filling it, which means that thorchain’s
    liquidity pool is a unique exchange environment that never requires a pairing
    of buyer and seller to transact. The Bifrost protocol also tracks the ratio of
    RUNE to the asset in the CLP.

    How does ThorChain differ from others?

    The attraction of ThorChain is that its chain-agnostic feature allows it to swap
    assets on a real basis. Unlike Ren, there is no wrapped BTC (e.g. renBTC) being
    created. Instead, we would be able to swap real ETH for real BTC. This is a milestone,
    as currently the closest Bitcoin is to DeFi is in its wrapped form. Thus, ThorChain
    brings BTC into DeFi. 

    Furthermore, as the network of new smart contract platforms grows (i.e. Solana and Polkadot),
    the number of chains is growing. The diversity of chains engenders the need for
    a trust-minimized and decentralized way to trade/swap tokens across chains, such
    as ThorChain. Currently, ThorChain is working on Polkadot, Solana, Monero, Cosmos
    (ATOM) and such, in anticipation of the launch of its mainnet. 


    So, what sets ThorChain apart is its cross-chain feature – which enables any asset
    to be swapped, and a pool created around it. This opens a whole new world of possibilities
    for DeFi users and its ecosystem alike. ThorChain has seen its popularity rise
    as it gained the attention of Multicoin Capital, where they announced that RUNE
    represents one of their largest public positions, because they believe that ThorChain
    plays an increasingly critical role within the crypto ecosystem. Currently, the
    multichain testnet is available and the mainnet is yet to be launched.'

  description: 'About Pyth Network

    The Pyth Network is the largest and fastest-growing first-party oracle network.
    Pyth delivers real-time market data to financial dApps across 40+ blockchains
    and provides 380+ low-latency price feeds across cryptocurrencies, equities, ETFs,
    FX pairs, and commodities.

    The network comprises some of the world''s largest exchanges, market makers, and
    financial services providers who contribute their own price data for use by smart
    contracts. Participants in the network include Binance, OKX, Jane Street, Bybit, Cboe
    Global Markets and more. The Pyth oracle program aggregates their data on-chain
    to guard against inaccuracies and manipulation. Finally, the protocol allows users
    to "pull" the latest price onto their blockchain when needed.

    In less than a year since the launch of the cross-chain pull oracle, the network
    has secured over $1B in total value. The Pyth Network has been used by over 250
    applications to secure $100B in trading volume. Integration with Pyth Price Feeds
    is permissionless.

    What Makes Pyth Network Unique?

    Pyth Network offers over 380 price feeds for cryptocurrencies, foreign exchange
    pairs, equities, ETFs, and commodities like gold and silver.

    Pyth oracle prices update every 400ms—more than 200,000 times a day—to enable
    precise and secure smart contract operations. Every Pyth Price Feed also provides
    a confidence interval “band” around the reported price to inform users about market
    volatility and uncertainty.

    Pyth’s price data comes from trusted institutions that contribute to the network.
    More than 90 data providers publish their proprietary price data to the Pyth Network
    for dApps to use. These sources include major crypto and traditional exchanges,
    trading firms, financial services providers, and DEXs.

    Notable crypto-native data providers include Binance, OKX, Bybit, Wintermute,
    Flow Traders, Auros, and QCP Capital. Data providers specializing in traditional
    finance include Cboe Global Markets, Jane Street, LMAX, Susquehanna International
    Group, Optiver, and IMC. Decentralized exchange data providers include Orca, Raydium,
    and 0x.

    Integration with Pyth Price Feeds is permissionless. Developers can tap into Pyth
    Price Feeds on more than 40 blockchains including Ethereum, Optimism, Arbitrum,
    zkSync Era, Base, BNB Chain, Solana and more. All 380+ Pyth Price Feeds are available
    to developers on every Pyth-supported blockchain, enabling rapid multi-chain expansion
    for smart contract protocols.

    History of Pyth Network

    The Pyth Network started in April 2021 as a collaboration between several individual
    contributors. Early contributors include the Pyth Network’s data providers, such
    as GTS, LMAX Group, Virtu, Jump Crypto as well as infrastructure partners such
    as Triton One and Blockdaemon.

    In 2021, the Pyth Data Association was founded to promote and grow the Pyth Network
    ecosystem. In 2023, Douro Labs was established as a new core contributor build
    the infrastructure and tooling necessary for expanding the network’s decentralized
    data services.

    What can PYTH be used for?

    PYTH is used as a governance token. Pyth Governance can determine high-level parameters
    of the oracle network’s mechanisms through on-chain voting by token-holders. The
    general purpose of coin-based governance systems is enabling token-holders to
    guide protocol development. Pyth’s on-chain governance can involve major protocol
    matters such as the size and denomination of oracle fees, the reward mechanism
    for data providers, and the listing of new data feeds. You can learn more about
    Pyth Governance from the official blog and whitepaper.'

  description: 'What is the Maker token (MKR)?

    The Maker token (MRK) is a governance token that is used to govern and recapitalize
    the Maker protocol. Holders of the token can participate and vote on changes to
    the protocol’s smart contract and system parameters such as Stability Fees and
    the Dai Savings Rate (DSR).

    What is Maker?

    Maker is a smart contract lending platform that enables users to take out loans
    by locking-in collateral in exchange for Dai. It was founded by the Maker Foundation
    in 2015 as an open-source project to offer economic freedom and opportunities
    to anyone, anywhere. In 2017, it launched the Maker governance token (MKR) and
    its first stablecoin iteration known as the Single Collateral Dai (SAI), which
    used Ether (ETH) as collateral.

    Two years later in 2019, the Foundation released the Multi-Collateral Dai (DAI),
    phasing out SAI. The platform has enjoyed widespread adoption and is the largest
    decentralized lending platform with around $2.58 billion in total value locked
    (TVL), as of December 2020.

    What can the Maker token (MKR) do?


    The Maker token has two core functions: i) governance and ii) recapitalization.
    In terms of governance, MKR token holders are responsible for monitoring, participating,
    and voting on proposals or changes to ensure the overall health of the Maker protocol.
    This is done via two types of polls which are executed through smart contracts:
    i) proposal polling and ii) executive polling.

    The former is used to gauge the consensus of the Maker community towards a proposed
    change. It is a preliminary step, conducted to ensure that proposals are well
    thought out before formal voting begins in executive polling. In that stage, MKR
    holders officially vote to approve or disapprove a proposal. The smart contract
    address which receives the highest number of MKR tokens is then elected as the
    active proposal. Further details on polls can be found in Maker’s whitepaper.

    Some examples of changes that have been proposed or implemented in the protocol
    are: adding a new collateral asset, modifying the Dai Savings Rate (DSR), choosing
    a set of oracle feeds and upgrading the Maker contract’s functionality. Users
    can view all current and previous polls, as well as their outcomes, on Maker’s
    governance page.  

    The second function of the MKR token is recapitalization. In the event that system
    debt exceeds surplus, additional MKR tokens are minted by the protocol and sold
    for Dai through debt auctions to help bring the ecosystem back from insolvency. 

    On the other hand, if system surplus exceeds debt, the protocol sells Dai via
    a surplus auction for MKR, which is subsequently burned. This mechanism incentivizes
    MKR holders to keep the system running as intended; bad governance will result
    in MKR value dilution and vice versa. More information on recapitalization can
    be found in Maker DAO’s community development page, while auctions are elaborated
    on here. 

    How does Maker work? 


    The Maker protocol functions similarly to a bank. It provides loans and charges
    interest on borrowings and savings denominated in its native stablecoin, Dai. 

    In traditional finance, these services are only ever provided after fulfilling
    several stringent requirements such as the provision of sufficient collateral,
    robust credit scores and compliance with KYC and criminal background checks. With
    Maker however, users need only provide collateral in the form of cryptocurrencies.
    No KYC is needed, and loans are issued in a decentralized manner via smart contracts. 

    In practice, a Dai loan is obtained by heading over to Oasis and locking-in collateral
    in smart contracts known as Maker Vaults. The loan amount would depend on two
    factors: i) the amount of collateral locked-in and ii) the chosen collateral’s
    collateralization ratio. 

    For instance, if a user chooses Ether (ETH) as collateral and the collateralization
    ratio of ETH is 150%, then the user would need to lock-in 1.5 ETH for every 1
    Dai he/she mints. And similar to a regular loan, a Dai loan will incur debt and
    accrue an interest fee known as the Stability Fee. However, it can also generate
    savings through the Dai Savings Rate mechanism (DSR). 

    The Maker token thus keeps the Maker ecosystem functioning smoothly by determining
    what cryptocurrencies are suitable to be used as collateral, the collateralization
    ratio required for these assets, their associated Stability Fees, and the DSR.
    In effect, it serves to regulate Dai’s soft-peg to the US dollar and keep Vaults
    overcollateralized. 

    Further explanation on the inner workings of Stability Fees, DSR and Dai can be
    read in the protocol’s whitepaper.'

    FLOW is the native currency for apps, games, and smart contracts built on top
    of the Flow blockchain, and thus is the currency guaranteed to be available for
    developers and users to transact with on the network. Developers can easily build
    FLOW directly into their apps for peer-to-peer payments, charging for services,
    or enabling consumers to earn rewards for the value they create. FLOW can also
    be held, transferred, or transacted by users peer-to-peer.

    ‍

    Token holders can earn rewards by staking their FLOW as a security deposit and
    working to secure the network through running validator nodes – or delegating
    their stake to professional operators to run validator nodes on their behalf.
    Validator nodes receive staking rewards and transaction fees in exchange for providing
    the security, computation, and storage services the network needs.  

    ‍

    Small amounts of FLOW token are also required for every activity on the network
    – from new user accounts to storage for assets and smart contracts. As the network
    matures, FLOW token holders will be able to use their FLOW in an evolving number
    of ways:


    Payment for computation and validation services (i.e., transaction fees)

    Medium of exchange

    Deposit for data storage

    Collateral for secondary tokens

    Participation in governance


    FLOW''s current supply

  description: 'What Is Bitcoin SV (BSV)?

    Bitcoin SV (BSV) emerged following a hard fork of the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) blockchain
    in 2018, which had in turn forked from the BTC blockchain a year earlier. The
    goal of Bitcoin SV is to fulfil the original vision of the Bitcoin protocol and
    design as described in Satoshi Nakamoto’s white paper. They aim to offer scalability
    and stability in line with the original description of Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer
    electronic cash system, as well as deliver a distributed data network that can
    support enterprise-level advanced blockchain applications. 

    Who are the founders of Bitcoin SV (BSV)?

    Blockchain technology company nChain developed the BSV node software. nChain Chief
    Scientist Craig Wright, who has claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto, has been a supporter
    of BSV since the split between BCH and BSV in 2018, following the proposal of
    controversial protocol changes by several BCH developers. After BSV split from
    BCH, a Switzerland-based non-profit industry association known as Bitcoin Association
    was formed that now supports the global growth and adoption of the BSV blockchain
    and digital currency.

    What makes Bitcoin SV (BSV) unique?

    BSV differs from other versions of Bitcoin in its adherence to the original Bitcoin
    protocol and focus on realising the vision for the Bitcoin network outlined in
    the Bitcoin white paper and other known Satoshi Nakamoto writings. Unlike BTC,
    which now primarily functions as an investment or store of value asset, BSV aims
    to offer a scalable and usable blockchain platform for efficient payments and
    distributed data applications for consumer, enterprise and government users. 

    How many Bitcoin SV (BSV) coins are there in circulation?

    There will be a maximum of 21 million BSV coins in circulation. Fresh coins from
    this circulation are distributed to BSV miners via block rewards, which they earn
    in addition to transaction fees for validating blocks.'

  description: 'What Is Tezos (XTZ)?


    Tezos is a high-performing blockchain and open-source platform for assets and
    applications, with a strong focus on code security, on-chain governance, and decentralization.
    Tezos 2.0, the upcoming step in the evolution of Tezos, aims to improve scalability
    (via layer 2s), composability, and to implement support to mainstream programming
    languages (like Javascript, Typescript, Python, and many others).


    Initially built with formal verification in mind, the Tezos protocol enables builders
    to avoid bugs when developing smart contracts, making it particularly suited to
    applications that require a high degree of security and certainty.


    Tezos’ LPoS (Liquid Proof-of-Stake) consensus mechanism enables any stakeholder
    to take part, directly or by delegation, in the consensus process, and to be rewarded
    for securing the network. Rather uniquely, Tezos’ on-chain governance system also
    enables stakeholders to create and vote on protocol upgrade proposals. This pioneering
    system allows the protocol to self-amend and upgrade itself without leading to
    a split (or fork) in the blockchain, empowering the community without slowing
    down innovation.


    First proposed in 2014 and launched in 2018, the Tezos Mainnet has a proven track
    record of running uninterrupted ever since, having earned a strong reputation
    for technical excellence and a supportive community. 


    Who Are the Founders of Tezos?

    Tezos was conceived by Arthur and Kathleen Breitman in a 2014 white paper under
    the pseudonym L.M. Goodman in a nod to Satoshi Nakamoto, referencing a journalist
    who had misidentified the creator of Bitcoin.


    In a previous paper, the Breitmans had argued that Bitcoin''s biggest shortcomings
    were the lack of a governance process that invited contributions from its community
    of users, cost and centralization issues raised by its proof-of-work system, the
    limited expressiveness of its programming language which didn’t allow for smart
    contracts, and security'

  description: 'What is Polygon?

    Polygon (Previously Matic Network) is the first well-structured, easy-to-use platform
    for Ethereum scaling and infrastructure development. Its core component is Polygon
    SDK, a modular, flexible framework that supports building multiple types of applications.

    Using Polygon, one can create Optimistic Rollup chains, ZK Rollup chains, stand
    alone chains or any other kind of infra required by the developer. 

    Polygon effectively transforms Ethereum into a full-fledged multi-chain system
    (aka Internet of Blockchains). This multi-chain system is akin to other ones such
    as Polkadot, Cosmos, Avalanche etc with the advantages of Ethereum’s security,
    vibrant ecosystem and openness.

    Nothing will change for the existing ecosystem built on the Plasma-POS chain.
    With Polygon, new features are being built around the existing proven technology
    to expand the ability to cater to diverse needs from the developer ecosystem.
    Polygon will continue to develop the core technology so that it can scale to a
    larger ecosystem. 

    The $MATIC token will continue to exist and will play an increasingly important
    role, securing the system and enabling governance.

  description: 'What is Flare (FLR)?

    Flare is a data-focused Layer 1 blockchain based on the Ethereum Virtual Machine
    (EVM). It allows developers to build interoperable applications with blockchains
    and the Internet. The project aims to provide decentralized access to high-integrity
    data for applications where data is important, such as DeFi, social networks,
    and real-world assets (RWA). 

    What Makes Flare Unique?

    Flare builds a decentralized data infrastructure natively into the blockchain,
    powered by many independent data providers. It allows developers to query, acquire,
    and process large amounts of data efficiently, securely, and without single, centralized
    sources. 

    How Does Flare Work?

    Flare’s native data acquisition protocols include the State Connector and the
    Flare Time Series Oracle (FTSO), and the data will be delivered to smart contracts
    and dApps on Flare.


    State Connector delivers static data from other blockchains and the Internet

    FTSO delivers dynamic data such as price feeds


    At the time of writing, Flare is also developing the FAssets system, allowing tokens
    on blockchains that do not support contracts to be used with smart contracts on
    the Flare blockchain, and LayerCake, which is a bridging system between smart
    contract networks.

    What is The Flare (FLR) Token Used For?

    FLR is the native token used for payments, transaction fees to prevent spam attacks
    and staking in validator nodes. FLR can also be wrapped into an ERC-20 variant,
    WFLR. WFLR tokens serve various functions; they can be delegated to FTSO data
    providers, or staked to participate in governance. These two uses are not mutually
    exclusive and do not prevent the tokens from being used in other EVM-compatible
    dApps and smart contracts on Flare.'

  description: 'About Decentraland

    Have you read or watched Ready Player One? If you have then you know where we
    are headed. Decentraland is a decentralized VR (virtual reality) world that is
    powered by the Ethereum blockchain. In this virtual world, you can purchase land,
    build it, monetize, and immerse into the applications and content that is built
    by other users. What distinguishes Decentraland from other VR projects is its
    decentralized nature. Land and in-game currency are powered by the Ethereum blockchain
    which give users complete ownership and promotes transparency.


    What is MANA?

    MANA refers to the native currency in Decentraland. It is an ERC-20 token powered
    by the Ethereum blockchain. Users can currently use MANA to purchase LAND and
    also pay for goods and services in Decentraland. MANA token can be purchased from
    various centralized exchanges, decentralized exchanges, and swap services.

    What is LAND?

    The concept of LAND in Decentraland refers to a parcel of land in the 3D virtual
    world. LAND is a non-fundigble token (NFT) powered by the Ethereum blockchain.
    Users have the opportunity to permanently own any LAND they purchase as the land
    titles are all traceable through the blockchain. They would then have total control
    on any 3D scenes they would like to build on the LAND. Individual parcels of land
    can be combined into estates to form larger plots of land. You may purchase LAND
    from secondary markets such as the Marketplace or OpenSea.

    How do I keep my MANA safe?

    Since MANA is an ERC-20 token, you can store it in any Ethereum compatible wallet.
    To stay secure, a good recommendation would be to use a hardware wallet such as
    Trezor or Ledger. If you are looking to interact with the Decentraland smart contracts,
    you an opt for wallets such as Metamask, MyEtherWallet, or MyCrypto.'

  description: 'What is the project about?

    FTN is the native coin of Bahamut - public, layer 1 EVM-based blockchain solution
    with a novelty consensus - PoSA. PoSA stands for Proof of Stake and Activity,
    where Activity is represented by the amount of gas spent by users when interacting
    with a validator-deployed smart contract. The more gas usage the given smart contract
    has, the more chances for the validator-deployer to become a block producer in
    future epochs.

    What makes your project unique?

    The main unique aspect of Bahamut is the PoSA consensus, which introduces new
    ways for businesses to monetize their user base, while preserving the integrity
    and transparency of the web3 space. 

    History of your project.

    FTN was originally an ERC20 token of SoftConstruct and Fastex ecosystems. After
    Bahamut mainnet launched on May 3, 2023 with FTN as its native coin, the migration
    process started from Ethereum to Bahamut and is still an ongoing process. 

    What’s next for your project?

    The infrastructure of Bahamut is constantly growing - users can expect decentralized
    exchanges, various apps, bridge services, and other essential aspects to be available
    on Bahamut before the end of the year. Also, Bahamut grant program is under way
    and will open the doors to everyone who wants to build a better decentralized
    future together.

    What can your token be used for?

    FTN is used in a variety of providers as a gaming token, and also the native coin
    for Bahamut network.'

  description: 'What is MultiversX?

    MultiversX (formerly Elrond) is a high-throughput blockchain that aims to power
    the metaverse frontier. MultiversX set out to create a blockchain that is capable
    of 1000x throughput than most existing blockchains. This improvement of transaction
    throughput allows MultiversX to handle even the most aggressive wave of user adoption.

    eGold (EGLD) is the native token that powers MultiversX. Its utility comprises
    all core network functionalities, such as staking, governance, transactions, smart
    contracts, and validator rewards.

    What are MultiversX’s Key Features?



    Adaptive State Sharding - Real-time splitting and merging of shards as the demand
    for network capacity changes. At any time, the MultiversX blockchain will juggle
    between network sharding, transaction sharding and state sharding, making the
    network capacity highly malleable as user demand requires.



    Secure Proof of Stake ("SPoS") consensus mechanism - In line with Sharding, the
    MultiversX Blockchain elects different validators within each shards in every
    validation round.



    Elrond VM - The Elrond Virtual Machine (EVM) is a dedicated smart contract execution
    engine built on WASM. Developers can build on The EVM in whichever language they’re
    familiar with to be compiled in WASM.



    How to Stake on MultiversX (Elrond)?

    Staking on MultiversX can be done either as a:


    Validator (running a node + 2,500 eGold stake), or

    Delegator, with a minimum of 10 eGold per delegation.


    Validator rewards are distributed automatically. Active Delegator rewards are
    claimable once per day, with no time limit for claims.

    You can currently stake eGold in the Elrond Delegation Waiting List. Go to https://wallet.elrond.com
    and click on the “Delegate” section in the left. An intuitive interface will help
    you to delegate into the Waiting List, claim Active Delegation rewards and withdraw
    from Active Delegation.

    A weekly 5,000 eGold reward is distributed to the delegators proportionally to
    the amount staked & time in the queue.'

  description: 'ApeCoin is for the Web3 Economy

    Culture has found new expression in web3 through art, gaming, entertainment, and
    events. The possibilities for blockchain’s impact on culture are so endless that
    they can’t possibly all be predicted yet. APE is a token made to support what’s
    next, controlled and built on by the community. It will serve as a decentralized
    protocol layer for community-led initiatives that drive culture forward into the
    metaverse. Yuga Labs is a web3 company best known for the creation of the Bored
    Ape NFT. It will be a community member in the ApeCoin DAO and will adopt APE as
    the primary token across new projects.

    The Ape Foundation

    The APE Foundation is the steward of ApeCoin. It is not an overseer, but the base
    layer on which ApeCoin holders in the ApeCoin DAO can build.

    The Foundation facilitates decentralized and community-led governance and is designed
    to become more decentralized over time. It is tasked with administering the decisions
    of the ApeCoin DAO, and is responsible for day-to-day administration, bookkeeping,
    project management, and other tasks that ensure the DAO community’s ideas have
    the support they need to become a reality.

    The goal of the APE Foundation is to steward the growth and development of the
    APE ecosystem in a fair and inclusive way. It utilizes the Ecosystem Fund, which
    is controlled by a multisig wallet, to pay its expenses as directed by the ApeCoin
    DAO and provides an infrastructure for ApeCoin holders to collaborate through
    open and permissionless governance processes.

    The DAO

    ApeCoin DAO exists because decentralized governance is critical to building and
    managing a globally dispersed community—and therefore critical to the success
    of the APE ecosystem.

    The APE Improvement Proposal Process (see Governance) will allow ApeCoin DAO members
    to make decisions regarding Ecosystem Fund allocations, governance rules, projects,
    partnerships, and beyond. ApeCoin DAO membership is open to all ApeCoin holders.

    The Board

    A special council on the APE Foundation (the DAO’s “Board”) provides, at the behest
    of the ApeCoin DAO members, oversight of the Foundation administrators. The purpose
    of the Board is to administer DAO proposals and serve the vision of the community.
    It meets on proposals requiring administrative review under ApeCoin DAO rules.
    The initial Board serves a term of six months, after which DAO members will vote
    annually on Board members.

    ApeCoin Protocol

    ApeCoin is an ERC-20 governance and utility token used within the APE ecosystem
    to empower a decentralized community building at the forefront of web3.

    As the open-source protocol layer of the ecosystem, ApeCoin serves several purposes:


    Governance - ApeCoin is the ecosystem’s governance token, allowing ApeCoin holders
    to participate in ApeCoin DAO.

    Unification of Spend - ApeCoin is the ecosystem’s utility token, giving all its
    participants a shared and open currency that can be used without centralized intermediaries.

    Access - ApeCoin provides access to certain parts of the ecosystem that are otherwise
    unavailable, such as exclusive games, merch, events, and services.

    Incentivization - ApeCoin is a tool for third-party developers to participate
    in the ecosystem by incorporating APE into services, games, and other projects.'

  description: 'What is CAKE?

    CAKE is the governance token for PancakeSwap.

    The supply of CAKE is not hard-capped. Theoretically, CAKE’s supply is unlimited.
    The team is looking into conducting regular token burns to make deflation higher
    than emission. For example, the team will burn 10% of the CAKE collected on lottery
    tickets and burn half of the fund raised through Initial Farm Offerings (IFO). 

    What is PancakeSwap?


    PancakeSwap is a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) built on top of Binance Smart Chain
    (BSC). It is the biggest Automated Market Maker (AMM) based exchange in BSC. 

    Binance Smart Chain has much lower transaction fees than Ethereum.

    How to start using Pancakeswap?

    Users will need to connect to the Binance Smart Chain in order to access Pancakeswap.
    It is possible to do so through Metamask or Binance Chain Wallet. Users will have
    to customize their Metamask with the following details after choosing custom RPC
    from the network’s option.


    Binance operates two different chains:



    Binance Chain - BEP 2



    Binance Smart Chain (BSC) - BEP 20



    Binance DEX is the primary decentralized app operating on Binance Chain. Most
    other projects are building on the Binance Smart Chain. The easiest way to convert
    any assets to its BEP 20 representation is through the Binance exchange. 

    For example, after depositing Bitcoin to Binance Exchange, users can choose to
    withdraw it in the forms of ERC 20 (ETH), BEP 2 (Binance Chain), BEP 20 (BSC),
    and BTC’s native chain. Choose BEP 20 if you would like to have the asset interact
    with PancakeSwap. 


    An alternative is through Binance Bridge, where users can swap the assets cross-chain
    from any L1 chain to BSC. 

    Users will need to have BNB to pay for any transaction fee on Binance Smart Chain,
    similar to how users will need ETH to pay for transaction fees on Ethereum.

    What are the fees incurred from using PancakeSwap?

    A token swap (trade) on the exchange will incur a 0.2% trading fee, broken down
    as follow: 



    0.17% - Returned to liquidity pools in the form of a fee reward for liquidity
    providers.



    0.03% - Sent to the PancakeSwap Treasury.



    How to provide liquidity in PancakeSwap?

    Like Uniswap, users will have to add two tokens into the Liquidity Pool in the
    ratio of 1:1. Users will receive FLIP tokens - PancakeSwap’s version of liquidity
    provider tokens - to represent their stake in the pool. 

    Like Sushiswap, PancakeSwap has a yield farming program where users can stake
    their LP tokens to earn CAKE rewards. 

    What are Syrup Pools?

    Syrup Pools allow Binance Smart Chain projects to bootstrap adoption by distributing
    a portion of their tokens to CAKE token holders. In exchange for that, projects
    will receive default listing on the PancakeSwap interface, obtaining priority
    promotion on the exchange by ranking temporarily first in the token selection
    list.

    What is the Cake Lottery?

    One lottery ticket cost 10 CAKE. Users will receive a random four-digit combination
    with each digit between 1-14, e.g., “1-9-3-2”. There is no limit on how many tickets
    users can buy. 

    The first prize winner will receive half of the lottery pool by matching the four
    winning numbers. Matching two and three numbers will also be entitled to prizes.
    Do find an example below: 


    For more details, please refer to the official Pancakeswap documentation.

    What is Initial Farm Offering (IFO)?

    Projects can launch new tokens by raising funds through the CAKE-BNB LP tokens.
    The project gets BNB tokens, PancakeSwap burns CAKE tokens, and users get the
    project’s tokens. CAKE tokens equating to half of the total funds raised will
    be burned forever. If $1,000,000 is raised, then $500,000 worth of CAKE tokens
    will be burned.'

    Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is a decentralized naming system on the Ethereum blockchain.
    Users can buy human-readable names like "bob.eth" and map it to identifiers such
    as addresses, content hashes, and metadata.

    ENS is often associated with the internet equivalent of DNS, the Domain Name Service
    such as google.com that is used to map against IP addresses while providing human
    readable naming.

    Unlike a DNS, ENS domains are owned by smart contracts and are governed by a DAO
    instead of a centralized authority similar to ICANN. Anyone can buy and sell an
    ENS name just like how you can buy an internet domain name.

    messages and ensures network security via proof-of-stake consensus.

    What Makes Axelar Unique?

    Most cross-chain solutions are bridges, which carry risk in the form of wrapped
    tokens and weak security. Axelar is a blockchain that connects blockchains, providing
    a programmable interchain layer that is Turing-complete: it can support any logic.
    As such, Axelar delivers features other cross-chain providers cannot duplicate.
    For example, Axelar supports:

    - General Message Passing (GMP), allowing applications to compose functions across
    ecosystems, including Cosmos-EVM.

    - A full-featured block explorer, Axelarscan, with metrics to track interchain
    growth and activity. 

    - One-time cross-chain deposit addresses that allow decentralized applications
    to onboard any token, with UX to rival that of centralized exchanges.

    - Axelar is built on proof-of-stake, the decentralized approach used by many of
    the chains it connects.Most other solutions are permissioned multisigs.

    History of Axelar

    Axelar was founded in 2020 by Algorand veterans Sergey Gorbunov and Georgios Vlachos.
    The white paper, released in 2021, pioneered ideas like arbitrary message passing
    cross-chain. Axelar''s backers include Binance, Coinbase, Dragonfly, Galaxy and
    Polychain. In February, 2022, the network launched to mainnet. Since then, Axelar
    has integrated 36+ blockchains, including Cosmos and EVM. About 100 projects are
    building on top of the network from multiple ecosystems.

    What’s Next for Axelar

    In February, 2023, at the Axelar-hosted Interop Summit at ETHDenver, Axelar announced
    the upcoming release of the Axelar Virtual Machine. Powered by Cosmwasm, the Axelar
    Virtual Machine turns interoperability into a programmable layer. It enables developers
    to write smart contracts on Axelar, while scaling their interchain deployments
    and “programming” the cross-chain networking layer. 

    What Can Axelar''s Native Token ($AXL) be Used For?

    To provide secure interoperability, Axelar network uses battle-tested proof-of-stake
    consensus. Network validators produce new blocks, participate in multiparty signing
    and vote on external chain states. As such, the native token $AXL has three important
    roles: 1) Tokenholders stake $AXL, delegating tokens to a validator’s staking
    pool and receiving rewards, minus the validator’s commission. 2) $AXL is used
    for governance, allowing stakers to exercise governance over proposals, such as
    a parameter change or protocol upgrade. 3) $AXL is used to pay network transaction
    fees to validators and tokenholders, but users of the Axelar network do not need
    to hold the token. Conversions into $AXL tokens and destination-chain tokens are
    handled on the back end via smart-contract logic, so that users need only pay
    gas once, in the source-chain token.

  description: 'What is Ethereum-based DYDX (ethDYDX)?

    ethDYDX was launched on August 3, 2021. ethDYDX is a governance token for the
    dYdX Layer 2 protocol built on Ethereum (“dYdX v3”). Token holders are able to
    govern certain parameters of dYdX v3 to align incentives between traders, liquidity
    providers, and partners. The ethDYDX token enables a robust ecosystem around governance,
    rewards, and staking - each of which is designed to drive future growth and decentralization
    of dYdX v3.

    Read this article to learn how dYdX v3 works.

    Migration to the dYdX Chain

    On June 22, 2022, dYdX Trading Inc.(“dYdX Trading”) announced the next iteration
    of the dYdX protocol - the dYdX Chain Open Source Software. The dYdX Chain is
    a proof-of-stake blockchain network and, as such, it requires a Layer 1 (“L1”)
    protocol token for staking to validators in order to secure the chain and for
    stakers of the L1 token to govern the network. Holders of the L1 token can use
    their L1 tokens to run a validator or stake their tokens to a validator in order
    to participate in securing and governing the network.

    The wethDYDX Smart Contract enables a potential migration of ethDYDX from Ethereum
    to the dYdX Chain.

    When interacted with, the wethDYDX Smart Contract would carry out the following
    functions in a fully permissionless and automated manner:


    Receive and permanently lock the ethDYDX tokens sent by the user to the wethDYDX
    Smart Contract;

    Send a wrapped version of the Ethereum-based DYDX token (“wethDYDX”) to the user
    on a 1-1 proportional basis on Ethereum; and

    dYdX Chain validators can also read and ingest the information in the wethDYDX
    Smart Contract such that corresponding DYDX can be distributed to users by validators
    on the dYdX Chain once there is confirmation that Step 1 above is complete and
    the ethDYDX is permanently locked in the wethDYDX Smart Contract.


    More information about the migration of ethDYDX from Ethereum to dYdX Chain is
    available here.'

  description: 'What is GnosisDAO?

    GnosisDAO builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem.

    In November 2021, both the xDAI and GnosisDAO community voted to combine their
    vibrant ecosystems to create the Gnosis Chain: an EVM compatible, community-owned
    network that prioritizes credible neutrality and resiliency. It uses the xDai
    token and includes a wide-ranging group of projects and users.

    The Gnosis mission has always been centered on experimentation and building decentralized
    infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem. When Gnosis was founded in 2015, it
    focused on building prediction markets to enable worldwide access to accurate
    information. While creating the prediction market platform, it became clear that
    Gnosis needed to build the infrastructure required to support it. Gnosis Safe,
    for example, was born of necessity.

    As a DAO, Gnosis uses the products that it creates to transparently guide decisions
    on the development, support, and governance of its ecosystem.

    Gnosis Safe (multisig and programmable account), Cow Protocol (formerly CowSwap
    and Gnosis Protocol), Conditional Tokens (prediction markets), Gnosis Auction,
    and Zodiac (standard and tooling for composable DAOs) are all products incubated
    by Gnosis. Their success can be attributed to the recent spin-out of Cow Protocol
    and the formation of SafeDAO. By combining needs-driven development with deep
    technical expertise, Gnosis has built the decentralized infrastructure for the
    Ethereum ecosystem.

    History of Gnosis

    Gnosis was founded in 2015 by Martin Köppelmann and Stefan George as part of ConsenSys,
    the globally leading Ethereum venture production studio. Friederike Ernst joined
    shortly thereafter as the third co-founder. Gnosis was the first team to launch
    a live application on Ethereum in 2016. Gnosis built  leading product lines that
    allowed users to securely create, trade, and hold digital assets.

    Gnosis additionally supports infrastructure required to make their mission thrive,
    including initiatives such as:



    Maintaining OpenEthereum, the fast, light, and robust client for Ethereum;



    Hosting DappCon, a nonprofit conference for the Ethereum ecosystem; 



    Founding and running Full Node, a co-working space for decentralized technology
    initiatives to work and collaborate;



    Investing in early-stage projects via the Gnosis Ecosystem Fund.



    What is Gnosis token (GNO)?

    The Gnosis token, GNO, is an Ethereum-based ERC-20 token sold during the Gnosis
    ICO. Gnosis raised funds through its utility token GNO in 2017. The total GNO
    supply is 10 Million. The Gnosis ICO was held on 24 April 2017, in which ~5% of
    the total supply was sold. Gnosis raised the equivalent of 12.5 Million USD (250
    000 ETH). Using a Dutch auction, the final price of GNO arrived at approximately
    29.84 USD.'

  description: 'What Is the EIGEN Token?

    The EIGEN token is a universal intersubjective work token designed for EigenLayer,
    enabling security for various digital tasks that are not just objectively verifiable
    but also intersubjectively attributable. Unlike traditional work tokens that are
    tied to one specific digital task or objective faults (verifiable on-chain), EIGEN
    addresses a broader category of faults where multiple external observers agree
    on whether the task was performed correctly. This expands the range of tasks that
    can be securely managed on a blockchain.

    EIGEN tokens are used for:



    Staking for intersubjective faults on the EigenLayer platform.



    Performing validation tasks across various Actively Validated Services (AVS).



    Incentivizing and penalizing operators based on their performance.



    What Are Intersubjectively Attributable Faults?

    Intersubjectively attributable faults are errors or failures in digital tasks
    that can’t necessarily be proven with cryptographic or on-chain evidence but can
    be agreed upon by external observers. Examples include:



    Data availability: Determining whether data is accessible across the network.



    AI inference accuracy: Evaluating AI model predictions within a certain margin
    of error.



    Oracle price inputs: Verifying the correctness of reported real-world data.



    The EIGEN token aims to secure services dealing with these intersubjective faults
    and ensure penalties are applied when operators deviate from expected behavior.

    How Does EIGEN Token Staking Work?

    EIGEN token staking involves locking up tokens as collateral to perform validation
    and coordination tasks. The key ideas behind staking with EIGEN are:



    Setup and Execution Phases: Rules for validation are agreed upon during the setup
    phase, and the execution phase involves enforcing these rules. This ensures that
    faults are observable and can be addressed without requiring in-person meetings.



    Slashing: When operators deviate from the agreed-upon rules, their staked tokens
    can be slashed as punishment.



    Token Forking: If the majority of stakers become malicious, a new fork of the
    EIGEN token can be initiated, penalizing those who caused the fault by excluding
    them from redeeming tokens in the new fork.



    How Many EIGEN Tokens Are in Circulation?

    The EIGEN token supply details will depend on the platform''s issuance policies.
    As of the time of its release, the tokenomics structure and total supply may be
    influenced by staking rewards, slashing events, and issuance for AVS security.

    What Makes EIGEN Unique?

    EIGEN is designed to resolve faults in decentralized tasks that are agreed upon
    by multiple external observers. Unlike traditional tokens that focus solely on
    objectively verifiable tasks, EIGEN addresses faults that may not be provable
    on-chain but are clearly identifiable off-chain. Its universality allows it to
    secure various tasks across many services on the EigenLayer platform.

    Key features include:



    Universality: EIGEN can be used across different tasks and systems beyond a single
    blockchain, offering cryptoeconomic security for a wide range of intersubjectively
    verifiable tasks.



    Isolation: The EIGEN token operates in tandem with its backing token, bEIGEN,
    ensuring that forks in staking don''t disrupt non-staking applications like DeFi.



    Compensation: In cases where an AVS is attacked, the system can redistribute slashed
    tokens to affected users, ensuring strong cryptoeconomic security.



    Who Can Use the EIGEN Token?

    The EIGEN token can be utilized by AVS developers, validators, and operators looking
    to secure services that require intersubjective agreement. It plays a complementary
    role to ETH restaking, where ETH can secure objectively verifiable tasks and EIGEN
    handles more subjective faults.'

  description: 'Arkham is a blockchain analysis platform that uses artificial intelligence
    (AI) to deanonymize the blockchain and on-chain data.

    The platform’s two main components are the Analytics Platform and Intel Exchange.
    The Analytics Platform covers analytics on various entities, exchanges, funds,
    whales and tokens. The Intel Exchange allows anyone to buy and sell address labels
    and other intelligence, either through bounties, auctions or the DATA Program.

    Unlike many other platforms that focus on specific blockchains or limited data
    sources, Arkham aims to provide total coverage of the blockchain by collecting
    and aggregating data from various chains. This is done leveraging its proprietary
    AI system, ULTRA. It allows users to analyze and gain insights from a comprehensive
    view of the crypto ecosystem.

     The Arkham Intel Exchange is a decentralized marketplace where users can buy
    and sell crypto intelligence using the native currency, ARKM. This unique feature
    enables individuals and organizations to monetize their intelligence by offering
    bounties and conducting auctions. The exchange connects buyers and sellers, fostering
    a vibrant community of on-chain sleuths and ensuring the availability of valuable
    intelligence for market participants.

    Arkham Intelligence was founded by Miguel Morel in 2020. Miguel is a veteran entrepreneur
    in cryptocurrency markets. Miguel’s experience navigating new crypto markets makes
    him familiar with the intelligence needs of decision makers in government, venture
    capital, and trading. He is also an investor in a number of technology startups.

    Arkham Intelligence has also attracted some of the most prominent investors in
    the crypto space and beyond. Among them are an undisclosed OpenAI Co-Founder,
    Palantir Co-Founder Joe Lonsdale (8VC), Tim Draper (Draper Associates), Wintermute,
    GSR, and Geoff Lewis (Bedrock). The company raised over $10 million in two rounds
    of equity financing, and was valued at $150 million in its last round.'

  description: 'What is Terra?

    Terra is a decentralized financial payment network that rebuilds the traditional
    payment stack on the blockchain. It utilizes a basket of fiat-pegged stablecoins,
    algorithmically stabilized by its reserve currency Luna, to facilitate programmable
    payments and open financial infrastructure development. As of December 2020, the
    network has transacted an estimated $299 billion for over 2 million users.

    What is Luna?

    Luna is the reserve currency of the Terra platform. It has three core functions:
    i) mine Terra transactions through staking, ii) ensure the price stability of
    Terra stablecoins and iii) provide incentives for the platform’s blockchain validators. 

    The Terra protocol runs on a Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchain, whereby miners must
    stake their Luna in order to mine transactions. All else being equal, a validator
    who has staked more Luna has a higher chance of generating the next Terra block
    compared to another validator who has staked less. In essence, Luna represents
    a validator’s mining power.

    However, in providing network security and validation, Luna holders and stakers
    are exposed to the price risks associated with the asset. This is because the
    Terra protocol readily exchanges Terra stablecoins for Luna at their determined
    exchange rate to maintain the peg. When demand is high and prices are above the
    peg, it will sell stablecoins for Luna. When demand is low and prices are below
    the peg, it does the opposite. In this way, validators absorb the short-term volatility
    of the network.

    To compensate for this, validators are given rewards in the form of: i) staking
    rewards, ii) gas fees, iii) taxes, and iv) seigniorage rewards. Staking rewards
    are determined by the size of a validator’s stake and are structured to incentivize
    transaction volume increases. Gas fees and taxes are similar in that a small fee
    is imposed on all Terra transactions, distributed to validators on a pro-rata
    basis. Finally, seigniorage rewards are given to validators who participate in
    the Luna exchange rate oracle process.

    These rewards seek to create mining demand that is stable and evergreen throughout
    all economic conditions. If rewards are increasing, the protocol decreases network
    fees and seigniorage rewards, and vice versa. More information on Luna and its
    rewards can be found in Terra’s Docs website, as well as in its whitepaper. Alternatively,
    you can watch our video to learn about the Luna ecosystem.

    How do Terra stablecoins maintain their price stability?

    The Terra network achieves price stability by algorithmically adjusting its supply
    based on fluctuations in demand. Once it detects that a Terra stablecoin has deviated
    from its peg, it will apply pressure to correct the deviation. 

    The protocol makes use of natural market forces to achieve this. For instance,
    if the price of 1 TerraUSD (UST) is above its $1 US dollar peg, the protocol must
    compensate by increasing the supply of UST. It mints some of the stablecoin and
    sells them on the open market. Arbitrageurs can then swap $1 US dollar worth of
    Luna in exchange for 1 TerraUSD and stand to profit. Minting and swapping occur
    until the supply of new UST is sufficient to bring back UST’s peg. 

    Likewise, should the price of 1 TerraUSD drop below its $1 US dollar target, the
    protocol will decrease the supply of the stablecoin. It mints Luna and sells them
    on the open market. Profit seekers can then exchange 1 UST for $1 US dollar worth
    of Luna and pocket the difference. In both cases, the Terra protocol prints as
    much stablecoin or Luna as necessary until the peg for each asset is satisfied.

    The protocol thus serves as a market-maker for Terra/Luna swaps. So long as there
    is a certain level of demand within the Terra ecosystem, either driven by Luna’s
    value or Terra’s transactions, the exchange of value between both assets preserves
    stability and mitigates volatility. To learn more about Terra’s price peg and
    the role that Luna plays in this mechanism, you can check out Terra’s stability
    mechanism page or its whitepaper.'

    Oasis is the leading privacy-enabled and scalable layer-1 blockchain network.
    It combines high throughput and low gas fees with secure architecture to provide
    a next-generation foundation for Web3 and will power DeFi, GameFi, NFTs, Metaverse,
    Data tokenization and Data DAOs. 

    Oasis propels web3 forward, scaling it and evolving it from infancy to maturity.
    Supported by top industry backers, Oasis recently announced the $235 million Ecosystem
    Fund to support projects to build on the network. Oasis Labs, the ecosystem technical
    contributor, has partnered with the likes of Meta, BMW Group Genetica and others,
    to build platforms and products that further individual privacy protection, data
    governance, and responsible data use. 

    What Makes Oasis Network Unique?

    Scalability: 

    The Oasis Network is multi-layered, making it highly flexible, scalable, and future-proof.
    The modular architecture separates consensus and smart contract execution into
    different layers allowing developers to deploy low-cost privacy-focused dApps. 

    The ParaTime Layer, a layer which allows for dynamic compute environments to be
    built, is where all smart contract execution happens, enabling incredible scalability
    for the network. ParaTimes can also evolve independently while maintaining consensus
    as security, scalability, or privacy technologies advance into the future.

    Privacy-Enabled: 

    The Oasis Network is the world’s leading scalable, privacy-enabled blockchain
    with its ParaTime layer enabling customizable confidentiality for developers.
    ParaTimes on the Oasis Network then leverage its privacy-preserving technology,
    enabling users to have complete control over the confidentiality of their information. 

    With the Cipher ParaTime, developers can experience a proper Web3 environment
    that is privacy-first and geared towards confidentiality. Cipher supports the
    building of complex confidential smart contracts, opening up a world of opportunities
    for users who want to be in charge of their data.

    EVM compatible. Solidity developers now can easily switch to Web3 in an environment
    that is familiar with tools that are well known, and built Web3 dApps like never
    before.

    A Foundation for Web3:

    Oasis is working to establish itself as the foundation for the Web3 world. The
    core value proposition of privacy gives way to other tenants required in the next
    iteration of the internet. Oasis supports critical pillars like decentralized
    identity, decentralized society, a responsible data economy and data sovereignty
    through its range of privacy-preserving technologies and robust blockchain platform.'

  description: 'What is CRV?

    CRV is the governance token for Curve Finance. It implemented a complex time-based
    staking system to exchange CRV into veCRV, where veCRV is an internal token intended
    for governance purposes and has a right to claim the cash flows generated by the
    protocol. 

    1 CRV locked for 4 years = 1veCRV

    1 CRV locked for 3 years = 0.75veCRV

    1 CRV locked for 2 years = 0.50veCRV

    1 CRV locked for 1 year = 0.25veCRV

    Curve Finance conducted one of the biggest retroactive token airdrops on 14 August
    2020 to reward early users, with a vesting period up to 4 years. It intends to
    have yield farming for all of its pool, with the reward weightage voted by the
    veCRV holders. 

    Yield Farming refers to the activity of depositing and locking capital in a DeFi
    Protocol for the reward of the protocol’s native tokens. DeFi protocols need to
    bootstrap capital to provide liquidity for exchanges, lend to borrowers, underwrite
    insurance risk, etc. It acts as an incentive to attract users to use the protocol
    while generating hype, giving out part of its native tokens. 

    Yield farmers will have to constantly monitor their veCRV power to get the maximum
    payout from the yield farming exercise as veCRV decays with time. There is a calculator
    built that shows this in detail. For further information do refer to the official
    documentation.

    What is Curve Finance?


    Similar to Uniswap, Curve Finance is an Automated Market Maker (AMM) based Decentralised
    Exchange (DEX). Unlike Uniswap, Curve focuses on allowing users to swap between
    assets that have very similar underlying value at the lowest slippage. This is
    useful in the DeFi ecosystem as there are plenty of wrapped tokens and synthetic
    tokens that aim to mimic the price of the real underlying asset. 

    For example, one of the biggest pools is 3CRV, which is a stablecoin pool consisting
    of DAI, USDT, and USDC. Their ratio in the pool will be based on the supply and
    demand of the market. Depositing a coin with a lesser ratio will yield the user
    a higher percentage of the pool. As such, when the ratio is heavily tilted to
    one of the coins, it may serve as a good chance for arbitrage.

    Curve Finance also supports yield-bearing tokens. For example, it collaborated
    with Yearn Finance to release yUSD pools that consisted of yDAI, yUSDT, yUSDC
    and yTUSD. Users that participated in this pool will not only have yield from
    the underlying yield-bearing tokens, but also the swap fees generated by the Curve
    pool. Including the yield farming rewards in terms of CRV tokens, liquidity providers
    of the pool actually have three sources of yield. 

    What is metapool?

    To promote the liquidity of more obscure tokens, Curve introduced the concept
    of base and meta pools. Metapools allow for one token to seemingly trade with
    another underlying base pool. This means we could create for example the following
    pool: [GUSD, [3CRV]].

    In this example users could seamlessly trade GUSD between the three coins in the
    3CRV (DAI/USDC/USDT). This is helpful in multiple ways:



    Prevents diluting existing pools



    Allows Curve to list less liquid assets



    More volume and more trading fees for the DAO



    The Metapool in question would take GUSD and 3CRV LP tokens. This means that liquidity
    providers of the 3CRV pool who do not provide liquidity in the GUSD Metapool are
    shielded from systemic risks from the Metapool.

    The similar base pool for BTC is sBTC Curve, consisting of wBTC, renBTC and sBTC.

    What is the pool factory?

    In collaboration with Yearn Finance, Curve has developed a pool factory, a way
    for anyone to deploy a Curve Metapool with the 3CRV or sBTC Pool.

    Before this, only the Curve DAO can deploy a new pool. Now, anyone can deploy
    a pool for stable or algo coins as well as a tokenized Bitcoin in a few clicks.

    There are a few parameters to be set:



    Swap Fee (0.04% - 1.00%)



    Amplification (A) Parameter (volatile algo coins need an A parameter around 5-10,
    for more information please refer to https://www.curve.fi/stableswap-paper.pdf)



    Pools created through pool factory has a few characteristics:



    It is not possible to destroy the Curve pools once deployed.



    Assets listed are not vetted by the Curve DAO, so users need to do their own research
    when trading those assets. This includes verifying the token addresses.



    The only admin change that can be made by the Curve DAO is ramping the A (amplification)
    parameter



    Tokens with more than 18 decimals are not supported



    Initial liquidity have to be seeded by the deployer



    Other than USD and BTC, are other assets supported?

    Curve Finance just launched the ETH and EUR pools, with support for more assets
    in the development pipeline. 

    ETH: sETH[ ETH, sETH], and stETH [ETH, stETH].

    EUR: eurs[eurs, seur]

    What are the benefits of providing liquidity to Curve pools?

    As an example, let''s look at stETH pool that provides four sources of yield.


    This can be viewed at the main page of Curve Finance. Looking at the Annual Percentage
    Yield (APY) figures, it shows that the Liquidity Providers (LPs) can roughly expect 



    3.33% APY from trading fees



    7.40% APY from LDO token rewards



    0.15% to 0.37% CRV token rewards (based on amount of veCRV locked). 



    What is not shown here is the staking yield available for stETH. 



    As of January 2021, the total yield would be in the range of 49%-57% APY. The
    exact APY hinges on the weekly gauge weight votes, veCRV boost, and the LDO rewards
    that are expected to only last for 1 month starting from 13 Jan 2021.

    The LDO and CRV tokens will have to be manually claimed and sold to ETH if the
    users only want to increase their ETH holdings, as such, it is simpler to use
    yield farming aggregators such as Yearn Finance that can do that automatically. 

    How to provide liquidity to Curve pools?

    Using the same example as above, after clicking the pool and going to the deposit
    tab, users are able to see the information about the selected pool.


    As shown, the ratio of the pool is now ETH (44.96%) and stETH(55.04%). Therefore,
    depositing ETH will yield a bonus pricing of 0.2%. 


    If users want to avoid any bonus or slippage in pricing, choose the ‘Add all coins
    in a balanced proportion’ option. 

    Stake in gauge basically means staking to earn the yield farming rewards of CRV
    tokens. 

    What is gauge weight?

    Gauge weight refers to the daily CRV rewards a pool receives. The following graph
    can be found at the “Gauge weight vote” tab under the Curve DAO. 


    From the graph we can see that the stETH pool is only expected to have 1.37% of
    the daily CRV rewards. The weights shown above are the voting result by the veCRV
    holders conducted every week.

    How to maximise the APY through vote locking veCRV?

    Using the same stETH vault above, let''s look at how to maximise the CRV rewards
    from the yield farming activity. A certain amount of veCRV is required to boost
    the CRV rewards up to max 2.5x. Below is the interface of the calculator.


    From the picture above it can be seen that locking 1000 CRV for two years will
    yield 500 veCRV and is expected to have a 1.99x boost on 1 ETH worth of assets
    in the stETH pool. If users already have assets in the pool, click the “Use existing
    deposit” option. 

    To achieve the maximum boost of 2.5x, users will need 760.84 veCRV. Users can
    lock 1,521.68 CRV for two years to achieve this. 

    The voting power applies to all pools the users have but may produce different
    boosts based on how much liquidity users are providing and how much total liquidity
    the pool has. veCRV decreases over time but the boost will only be updated at
    certain checkpoints like withdrawing, depositing into a pool, or claiming CRV
    rewards. Constant monitoring is required to maintain max boost. 

    What are the fees to use Curve Finance?

    Most swaps on Curve cost 0.04% in fees. 50% of the fees go to veCRV holders and
    50% of the fees go to Liquidity Providers (LPs). Pools that are launched through
    the pool factory can support up to 1% in fees. For up to date information, go
    to the deposit page of the selected pool like shown above where the total fee
    and admin fee (fees earned by veCRV holders) are shown.'

  description: 'What is the Compound Protocol?

    Compound is a decentralized blockchain protocol that allows users to lend or borrow
    selected cryptocurrencies. It establishes money markets by pooling assets together
    and algorithmically setting interest rates based on supply and demand of assets.

    To supply or lend crypto assets on Compound, users will have to deposit their
    crypto assets into the Compound protocol and it will be aggregated into a liquidity
    pool. Once users have made the deposit, they will receive cTokens in return. Users
    will start accruing interest by holding the cTokens. 

    Once assets are supplied to Compound, users are allowed to use the assets as collateral.
    Based on the collateral factor of the assets deposited, users can start borrowing
    from Compound. Because Compound uses an overcollateralization model, you can never
    borrow more than what is collateralized.


    Who founded Compound?

    Compound was founded by long-time business partners Robert Leshner and Geoffrey
    Hayes in 2017. Compound was officially launched on the Ethereum mainnet in 2018,
    and their headquarters is in San Francisco. 

    What is COMP?

    COMP is the governance token for Compound Protocol and it was distributed since
    June 2020. It is an ERC-20 token issued on Ethereum. 

    COMP tokens are mainly used for protocol governance. COMP holders can suggest,
    debate, and implement changes to Compound - without relying on, or requiring,
    the Compound team whatsoever. COMP also allows its owner to delegate voting rights
    to an address of their choice.

    How is Compound different from traditional finance?

    Compound behaves similarly to a bank but it is more easily accessible. To use
    Compound, users are not required to provide personal and private information.
    Anyone with an internet connection could sign up for Compound and start interacting
    with the protocol. All they need is some crypto assets stored on a crypto wallet
    like Metamask.

    In addition, the return rates for Compound are more attractive compared to traditional
    banks. For example, if you store money in a savings account, it will only generate
    a measly 0.05% APY. On the other hand, Compound would offer up to 4% APY depending
    on the assets supplied. 

    Do note that the higher interest rate offered is due to the additional risks incurred
    by using the Compound smart contract.

    Who are competitors of Compound Protocol?

    Any services that facilitate lending of money is a competitor of Compound. In
    centralized finance, there are banks, money markets, and crypto lending services
    such as Nexo, Crypto.com, Celsius Network, Binance, and more. In DeFi, there are
    other competing services such as Aave.

    How did Compound contribute to the yield farming / liquidity mining craze?

    Yield farming is a process that allows users to earn a return on their crypto
    assets by providing it to Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols such as Compound.
    Liquidity mining is an additional incentive structure given through the reward
    of governance tokens to incentivize users to provide more liquidity to DeFi protocols. 

    The release of COMP tokens in June 2020 jump started the yield farming and liquidity
    mining movement during the summer of 2020. COMP tokens were given to users who
    lent and borrowed assets on the Compound platform. This incentive made Compound
    extremely popular and significantly increased the assets lent and borrowed on
    Compound. 

    How to farm for COMP?


    If you supply or borrow assets on Compound, you will be rewarded with an allocation
    of COMP, of which 2,880 COMP are distributed daily. COMP tokens are distributed
    among the various money markets based on the dollar value of assets borrowed.
    Currently DAI has the highest demand, receiving about 60% of the daily COMP distribution.
    The allocation is then split equally between suppliers and borrowers.

    Which assets are supported on Compound?

    As of December 2020, there are 9 tokens available on Compound. The supported assets
    are DAI, ETH, USDC, ZRX, USDT, WBTC, BAT, UNI, COMP. 


    How does Compound Governance work?


     

    A user must have 100,000 COMP tokens on hand or delegated from other users to
    table a proposal. Once submitted, there is a 3-day voting period wherein a minimum
    of 400,000 votes must be cast. If a majority of the votes support the proposal,
    the new change will be implemented after a 2-day waiting period. 

    These proposals may include adding support for a new asset, changing an asset’s
    collateral factor, changing a market’s interest rate model, or changing any other
    protocol parameter or variable. These proposals will be in the form of executable
    codes, not suggestions for the team to implement.

  description: 'What Is Kava (KAVA)?

    Kava is a Layer-1 blockchain that combines the speed and interoperability of Cosmos
    with the developer power of Ethereum. 

    The Kava Network uses a developer-optimized co-chain architecture. The Ethereum
    Co-Chain enables support for EVM smart contracts while the Cosmos Co-Chain enables
    the lightning-fast Tendermint consensus engine and the Inter Blockchain Communication
    Protocol (IBC). 

    The two co-chains are connected by a translator module that enables them to interoperate
    seamlessly, bringing the two most used blockchain development environments together
    in a single, scalable network.

    The Kava Network features a native governance and utility token, KAVA, that can
    be staked by validators or delegated to validator nodes. Stakers and delegators
    earn 37.5% of all KAVA emissions as a reward for securing the network. Kava stakers
    also have voting rights in network governance proposals.

    What Makes Kava Unique?

    The Kava Network utilizes a developer-optimized co-chain architecture that delivers
    the development power of Ethereum with the speed, interoperability, and low transaction
    fees of Cosmos in a single network.

    The Kava Network empowers developers with:



    Flexible Deployment: Developers can build and deploy on either of the two most
    used permissionless execution environments in the world using the EVM-compatible
    Ethereum Co-Chain or the Cosmos Co-Chain.



    On-Chain Incentives: A transparent and decentralized on-chain incentive model
    ensures that the best developers and projects in every Web3 vertical (including
    DeFi, GameFi, and NFTs) are rewarded for their contributions with a proportional
    share of the value and governance of the network.



    Seamless Interoperability: Developers can deploy Solidity smart contracts that
    interoperate seamlessly with Cosmos SDK protocols in the same network, connecting
    their project to every major asset and millions of users.



    How Is the Kava Network Secured?

    Kava is built on Cosmos and uses a Tendermint-based proof-of-stake (POS) consensus
    mechanism to ensure the integrity of the network.

    The Kava Network uses a network of validator nodes for confirming transactions.
    These validator nodes must put up collateral to take up the duty of validating
    transactions. If validators misbehave or fail to meet rigorous minimum requirements,
    their stake will be penalized — thereby incentivizing validators to remain honest
    and efficient.

    Kava holders can run a staking node to earn KAVA rewards directly from the protocol.
    However, only the top 100 Kava nodes (also known as validators) are eligible to
    receive these rewards. Beyond this, KAVA holders can stake their tokens on various
    compatible exchange platforms, like Binance, Kraken, Huobi Pool, and in wallets
    like Trust Wallet, Cosmostation Wallet, and Keplr.

    Multiple independent blockchains and crypto security firms have audited Kava’s
    smart contracts, including CertiK, B-Harvest, and Quantstamp. To date, no vulnerabilities
    have been found.

    Kava Governance

    The KavaDAO is a fully decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governing the
    Kava Network. KAVA stakers and validators secure and run the network; thus, their
    responsibility is to table and vote on proposals that affect the Kava Network.

    These changes can take the form of smart contract modifications, adjustments to
    the global debt limit, the addition or removal of collateral assets, among other
    considerations. Voting can be conducted either directly or delegated to validators.
    The numerous implemented and proposed changes are accessible via Kava’s governance

  description: 'What is Safe

    Safe (formerly known as Gnosis Safe) lets individuals and businesses manage their
    digital assets securely. It is a multi-sign wallet that runs on multiple networks,
    requiring a minimum number of users to approve a transaction before it can proceed
    (M-of-N).

    Unlike a single key wallet, where you may lose complete access to your funds if
    your private key is lost or stolen, Safe removes that single point of failure
    by requiring a certain number of approvals from designated wallets’ owners before
    approving a transaction.

    History of Safe

    Gnosis Safe was a part of Ethereum infrastructure builder Gnosis until April 2022,
    when the community voted to spin Safe off from Gnosis. Along with the rebranding
    of Gnosis Safe to Safe, the SAFE governance token was launched to govern and curate
    essential infrastructure components of the Safe ecosystem.

    How Safe works

    Safe functions as a deployed smart contract that uses multi-sig, where it implements
    predefined instructions once they are met (to release funds after M-of-N users
    approve a transaction).

    Multi-sig wallets enable businesses and individuals to:


    Perform sensitive transactions securely: Any actions need to be authenticated
    by the majority.

    Manage funds safely: The majority have to give their consent for any movement
    of funds, preventing a single person from running away with everything.

    Achieve redundancy: The wallet can still be accessed with the other keys even
    if one is lost.


    Unique features of Safe

    Beyond multi-signature, Safe also includes the following features:


    Supports a wide range of assets: Assets supported on Safe includes ETH, ERC20
    (tokens) and ERC721 (collectibles). Safe also includes the USD conversion rate
    of assets held on the wallet.

    Integrates with other wallets: Transactions can be signed with hardware, software,
    or even paper wallets.

    Secure apps: Users can interact with DeFi protocols directly from its interface.'

  description: 'What is Kusama?

    Kusama is a public blockchain network that is running the exact same codebase
    as Polkadot. It is aimed to be a canary build for the Polkadot network which is
    an experimental and development environment for new features that will eventually
    be deployed to Polkadot. Because of the experimental nature of Kusama, the developmental
    speed is much faster and it has seen significant traction since launched in 2019.

    Notable projects that have expressed interest to deploy on the Polkadot network
    are also treating Kusama as an experimental sister chain. For example, the Acala
    DeFi network which was planned to be rolled out on Polkadot, will begin deploying
    the Karura network on Kusama first.

    Who created Kusama?

    Founders of the project include team members of Polkadot such as Gavin Wood (whom
    used to found Ethereum with Vitalik Buterin and team), Peter Czaban, and Robert
    Habermeier. 

    What is the Kusama Parachain Slot Auction?

    The Kusama network consists of a multi chain architecture. These chains (also
    called parachains) are interconnected with each other within the network through
    leasing a slot on the Relay Chain. In order for a chain to obtain a slot, projects
    will need to bid for it via an auction. The Parachain Slot Auction is conducted
    in order to allocated slots to the projects that have the most KSM bonded coins.

    In order to raise enough KSM to secure a slot, projects may opt for a parachain
    loan offering to raise KSM from the public. Holders will need to bond and lock
    their KSM coins with the project that they are interested to support with the
    hope that the project will secure a slot and go live with the network. As auction
    participants will be taking risks of locking up their KSM, projects would typically
    offer some sort of reward incentives, one option would be for them to offer their
    own native token should the network launches.For example, Karura is offering 12
    KAR tokens for every 1 KSM that is contributed to their loan offering.

    Projects should opt to using the Kusama built-in crowdloan module when confucting
    the loan offering to ensure users funds are protected and remains locked for the
    purpose of the slot lease.

    The Kusama auction guide is a great place to read more about the entire mechanism.

    How can I participate in a Kusama parachain auction?

    Users can choose to participate in the parachain auction in the form of a crowdloan.
    This can be done through a centralized exchange or decentralized services. They
    would also need to hold some KSM coins.

    Exchanges such as Kraken, Kucoin, and Okex supports parachain auctions directly
    within their exchange.

    For a decentralized options, users can consider Bounce, Math Wallet, or interacting
    with the Polkadot.js on the project website directly.

    Where can I find all the projects that are participating in the auction and offering
    a crowdloan?

    You may visit the Subscan explorer crowdloan section to follow real time progress
    of the crowdloan.'

  description: 'What is 1inch Network?

    The 1inch Network unites decentralized protocols whose synergy enables the most
    lucrative, fastest and protected operations in the DeFi space. 1inch offers access
    to hundreds of liquidity sources across multiple chains. It consists of five major
    components:


    The 1inch dApp is a web-based application that is connected to all supported blockchains
    via smart contracts. The dApp offers access to deep aggregated liquidity and competitive
    token swap rates on various DEXes, with unique features, including partial fill
    and the ability to find the best swap paths across multiple liquidity sources.

    The 1inch Aggregation Protocol facilitates cost-efficient and secure swap transactions
    across multiple liquidity sources.

    The 1inch Limit Order Protocol provides the most innovative and flexible limit
    order swap opportunities in DeFi.

    The 1inch Liquidity Protocol is a next-generation automated market maker that
    protects users from front-running attacks and offers attractive opportunities
    to liquidity providers

    The 1inch Wallet is a fast and secure mobile application for storing, receiving,
    sending and swapping crypto assets.


    What Makes 1inch Unique?

    A unique set of protocols working together makes the project unique. Their synergy
    has made it possible to develop the 1inch Swap Engine.

    Partially based on the existing tech, including the 1inch Limit Order Protocol
    and the 1inch Aggregation Protocol, the 1inch Swap Engine is a decentralized trading
    and matching system that connects DeFi users with practically limitless liquidity
    — both centralized and decentralized — through professional market makers. Basically,
    the 1inch Swap Engine offers users access to almost all available liquidity in
    the crypto market.

    The 1inch Swap Engine facilitates Fusion mode, which empowers DeFi users to place
    orders with a specified price and time range, paying no network fees.

    History of 1inch

    The 1inch Network was launched at the ETHGlobal New York hackathon in May 2019
    with the release of its Aggregation Protocol v1. Since then, the 1inch Network
    has developed additional DeFi tools such as the Liquidity Protocol, the Limit
    Order Protocol, P2P transactions, and the 1inch Wallet app.

    What’s Next for 1inch?

    The project doesn’t provide any public roadmap, as in such a quickly changing
    DeFi space 1inch is strongly focused on delivering any developments first and
    only afterwards to make any announcements.

    What Can 1INCH (token) Be Used For?

    The 1INCH token is the governance and utility token of the 1inch Network. 1INCH
    holders can stake their tokens to participate in the 1inch Network''s DAO governance.
    Also, holders can choose resolvers and earn a part of their fees.

    With the 1inch Fusion, users can stake 1INCH tokens to receive Unicorn Power (UP),
    then subsequently delegate their UP to any 1inch Fusion Resolver to start receiving
    rewards from them. When staking, there is the option to set a custom or preset
    lock period. User’s st1INCH tokens cannot be unstaked/withdrawn without penalty
    until the designated lock period expires.'

  description: 'What is tBTC?

    tBTC allows you to unlock your Bitcoin’s value to borrow and lend, mint stablecoins,
    provide liquidity, and much more. tBTC is a decentralized wrapped Bitcoin that
    is 1:1 backed by main-net BTC. Existing solutions bringing Bitcoin to Ethereum
    require you to send your Bitcoin to an intermediary, who then issues you an Ethereum
    token representing your original asset. This centralized model requires you to
    trust a third party and is prone to censorship, sacrificing Bitcoin''s promise
    of secure, permissionless decentralization.

     

    How does tBTC solve this issue?

    Instead of centralized intermediaries, tBTC uses a randomly selected group of
    operators running nodes on the Threshold Network to secure deposited Bitcoin through
    threshold cryptography. That means tBTC requires a threshold majority agreement
    before operators perform any action with your Bitcoin. By rotating the selection
    of operators weekly, tBTC protects against any individual or group of operators
    colluding to fraudulently seize the underlying deposits. By relying on an honest-majority-assumption,
    we can calculate the likelihood any wallet comprised of a quorum of dishonest
    operators. An insurance backstop (the coverage pools), serves as an emergency
    fallback in the event a wallet is compromised.

    What is Threshold Network?

    Threshold.network stems from the merger of NuCypher and Keep networks into a single
    decentralized network — it delivers a suite of threshold cryptography services
    for web3 applications through a decentralized network of staking nodes. The whole
    community is governed by a DAO. Flagship services of Threshold Network include
    Threshold Access Control (TACo) – which enables end-to-end encrypted data sharing
    and communication without the need to trust a centralized authority, tBTC v2 -
    the only decentralized and permissionless Bitcoin-to-Ethereum asset bridge and
    thUSD - an overcollateralized and decentralized USD stablecoin that uses both
    ETH and tBTC as collateral.'

  description: 'What is Enjin Coin?

    Enjin Coin is a cryptocurrency for virtual goods created by Enjin. Enjin is the
    “largest gaming community platform online” with over 250,000 gaming communities
    and 18.7 million registered gamers. The Enjin team is designing the coin completely
    around gaming with the goal of it being the most usable cryptocurrency for the
    industry. The project includes the Enjin Coin as well as a suite of software development
    kits (SDKs) that developers can integrate into their games and communities. Bringing
    blockchain to gaming helps to reduce the high fees and fraud that’s prevalent
    in the transfer of virtual goods.

    Enjin Coin is an ERC20 token built on the Ethereum network. With that, the project
    not only acts as a cryptocurrency but also has smart contract capabilities. It’s
    also one of the first projects testing the Raiden Network, Ethereum’s version
    of the Lightning Network. The Enjin Coin platform provides a laundry list of features
    through its public API and SDKs. To keep things brief, though, we’ll only be discussing
    a few of the major ones in this article. The largest value Enjin Coin brings to
    the gaming community is in its creation and management of virtual goods. Developers
    on each platform can easily create a currency unique to their community that’s
    backed by Enjin Coin as the parent currency. This gives the coins all the benefits
    of the blockchain (speed, cost, security, etc…) while still staying customized
    to their respective platforms.

    Enjin, the company behind Enjin Coin, is the largest online gaming community creation
    platform. Started in 2009, the company receives 60 million views per month and
    transacts millions of U.S. dollars each month in their community stores. The team
    is deploying Enjin Coin across the entire Enjin CMS platform – over 250,000 gaming
    websites. Advisors to the project consist of Anthony Diiorio (Ethereum co-founder)
    and Pat LaBine (previous producer and technical director at Bioware). Enjin has
    also formed partnerships with Unity, PC Gamer, and NRG eSports. The team held
    a successful ICO in late 2017 in which they raised ~$35 million between the private
    and public rounds. Although it’s still a young project, the team spent the last
    quarter of 2017 building the Platform API, Mobile Smart Wallet, and a Java SDK
    alongside creating a Minecraft plugin. They’ve got plenty in store for 2018, but
    the highlights include various platform plugins, the Efinity release, and numerous
    other SDKs.

    Enjin also features a tool known as TopLists, which allow users to rank games,
    servers, teams and any other item. TopLists will be deployed as a decentralized
    smart contract with functionalities that will allow for market bidding or democratic
    voting. List creators are incentivized to promote and market their list because
    these creators will receive tokens when users perform tasks such as voting on
    their list. Enjin Coin is an ambitious project that aims to integrate online virtual
    gaming with decentralized technologies. Enjin Coin project promises a lot, and
    it is only with the passage of time that we will able to see if it can deliver
    on those promises.'

  description: 'What Is Golem Network?


    Golem Network is an open-source, decentralized computing platform that is building
    an ecosystem to provide computing power to the AI industry. A peer-to-peer marketplace
    for distributed computing resources. Users engage directly on the Golem platform,
    exchanging GLM tokens for the utilization of their idle computing resources.

    Golem allows to break down tasks into smaller subtasks and distribute them across
    multiple providers, enabling parallel processing. This approach boosts efficiency
    and speeds up the completion of complex computations.

    What is GLM?

    GLM or Golem Network Token is needed to pay for computations on the network and
    is the currency that drives the marketplace. As a Requestor, you set a bid for
    an amount of GLM you are willing to pay to have your task completed. As a Provider,
    you earn GLM by computing tasks for Requestors.

    How can I get involved?

    If you want to stay up to date with the latest developments and updates, join
    the Golem Network Discord community here: https://chat.golem.network/

    On Discord you can also find support to become a Provider or a Requestor in the

  description: 'What is Zilliqa (ZIL)?

    Zilliqa (ZIL) is a token developed in the year 2017. Zilliqa is mainly based on
    the concept of Sharding and primarily aims at improving the scalability of the
    cryptocurrency networks as in case of Bitcoin or Ethereum. The white paper mentions
    that the transactions speed would be approximately a thousand times more than
    that of Ethereum network. Ziliqa is fast, secured and decentralized. Zilliqa’s
    high throughput means that you can focus on developing your ideas without worrying
    about network congestion, high transaction fees or security which are the key
    issues with legacy blockchain platforms.

    Zilliqa''s Sharding Mechanism

    Zilliqa network uses a concept called Sharding where the transactions are grouped
    into smaller groups and divided among the miners for the parallel transactional
    verification. Developing smaller groups for transactional verification means the
    Consensus can be reached faster and hence a higher number of transactions can
    be processed in a given time frame. The capacity of the network linearly increases
    in other cryptocurrencies as the number of people joins the network, but in this
    case, the capacity is increased at a higher variable rate than the number of members
    joining the network.

    By incorporating the Sharding Technology, it can completely revolutionize the
    smart contract functionality too. Ziliqa has few pros as it has a great new technology.
    Zilliqa is the first platform to use sharding technology. This puts it ahead of
    the rest of the market. It’s a completely new kind of blockchain designed to solve
    the problem of scalability. Third-generation platforms like Zilliqa could be the
    big winners in the future of cryptocurrency.

    Ziliqa has a strong community. The platform has a lot of fans. The Zilliqa ICO
    only happened because there was so much demand for it. The Zilliqa ICO also shows
    that the crypto community is ready to see blockchain technology move to the next
    phase of its development.'

  description: 'What is ZRX?

    ZRX is the governance token for the 0x protocol. ZRX holders have the authority
    to influence the direction of the protocol by voting on proposals.

    What is 0x?

    0x is a protocol that aims to facilitate a frictionless peer-to-peer exchange
    of Ethereum-based assets. 0x is considered a non-custodial solution because funds
    are deposited or withdrawn from the user''s wallet. It aggregates liquidity pools
    from different projects that are built on top of 0x for smoother peer-to-peer
    transactions. 

    Also, it behaves as the building block for developers that are looking for exchange
    functionality. 0x allows easy integration for developers through its relayers
    which adds exchange functionality on top of an existing product. 0x’s vision is
    to enable a direct, non-custodial wallet-to-wallet trading of any ERC-20 tokens
    on any Ethereum based platforms. 

    0x currently has three main products:



    0x API - Gain access to decentralized exchanges (DEX) liquidity through an API
    and swap token for the best price



    Matcha - An aggregator of decentralized exchanges allowing users to find the best
    prices for token swaps



    0x Mesh - Gain access to a global peer-to-peer orderbook for token trades



    How does 0x work?

    The 0x network revolves around the maker and taker. Maker is the party that creates
    a buy or sell order while taker is the party that fills the order. Currently 0x
    supports trading for ERC-20 fungible tokens.  

    0x allows order makers to securely initiate a transaction with digital signatures
    and an 0x order is only considered valid after it has met all of the steps shown
    in the image below.


    In order for a trade to occur, there needs to be someone on the other side of
    the trade. If the maker already has a desired counter-party, they could directly
    send the 0x order to them. Otherwise, the order will be sent to a relayer in hopes
    of finding a counter-party.  

    A relayer is an entity that helps to create, find, and fill 0x orders. Anyone
    can build a 0x relayer and begin earning fees for every trade it facilitates

    Once someone finds and fills the 0x order, the 0x protocol’s settlement logic
    will verify the maker’s digital signature and make sure the conditions of the
    trade are completely met. If everything is in order, tokens will be automatically
    swapped between maker and taker. Otherwise, the request will be rejected. 

    Because 0x supports ERC-721 non-fungible tokens (NFT) as well, there could be
    a viable use case for gaming or digital artwork scenarios. Gamers can tokenize
    their in-game assets and trade among themselves. Artists can also digitize their
    artwork into a NFT and turn it into a trading product. 


    Does 0x store orders on-chain?


    Unlike other decentralized exchanges, 0x does not store its orders on the blockchain.
    Instead orders are stored off-chain and trade settlements are only taken place
    on-chain. By taking transactions off-chain, there will be less congestion within
    the network and it would demand lower gas cost to operate within the 0x ecosystem.

    The only part where the transaction occurs on-chain is the actual value transfer. 

    What can I do with ZRX?

    Users can stake ZRX tokens with the staking pools available in the ZRX Portal
    and start earning ETH as rewards. If users are unsure about which staking pool
    to stake with, they can refer to the staking wizard for an easier process.'

  description: 'What is Reserve Rights Token (RSR)?

    Reserve Rights (RSR) is an ERC-20 token that serves two main purposes for the
    Reserve protocol: overcollateralization of Reserve stablecoins (RTokens) through
    staking and governing them through proposing & voting on changes to their configuration.

    The Reserve Rights (RSR) token was launched in May 2019 following a successful
    initial exchange offering IEO on the Huobi Prime platform.

     

    What is Reserve Rights (RSR) used for?

    Besides being the governance token for Reserve stablecoins (RTokens), by which
    changes to RTokens can be proposed & voted for with RSR, Reserve Rights exists
    as a backstop to make Reserve stablecoin (RToken) holders whole in the unlikely
    event of a collateral token default. In order for RSR holders to provide this
    overcollateralization, they can decide to stake on any one RToken, or divide their
    RSR tokens by staking on multiple RTokens. RSR holders can also decide not to
    stake their RSR at all.

    In return for providing this first-loss capital, RSR stakers can expect to receive
    a portion of the revenue the RToken they stake on makes. As a general rule, RSR
    stakers can expect higher returns (APYs) the bigger the market cap of the RToken
    they stake on becomes.

    In contrast with the “staking” you see in a lot of other projects these days,
    RSR staking is built to last. In Reserve’s model, late participants do not pay
    for early participants, nor is a trust in staking of other parties required.

    For more detailed information on RSR staking, please refer to the RSR staking
    section in the protocol documentation: https://reserve.org/protocol/reserve_rights_rsr/#reserve-rights-staking.

     

    Who are the founders of Reserve?

    Reserve was co-founded by Nevin Freeman and Matt Elder. Freeman is a seasoned
    entrepreneur. He describes his life goal as "solving the coordination problems
    that are stopping humanity from achieving its potential."

    Matt Elder, on the other hand, is an experienced engineer who previously worked
    for Google and Quixey, and worked to oversee the architecture of the Reserve protocol''s
    technical implementation.

    Since its launch in 2019, the amount of contributors to the Reserve ecosystem
    has grown considerably, including community, engineers, and legal and compliance
    staff — all unified under the shared ambition to position Reserve as an open,
    massively scalable stablecoin platform that promotes economic prosperity.

     

    What Makes Reserve Rights Unique?

    Unlike other stablecoins that are typically backed by U.S. dollars (USD) held
    in reserve in a bank account controlled by the stablecoin issuer or a trusted
    custodian, Reserve stablecoins are backed by a basket of cryptocurrencies managed
    by smart contracts.

    These baskets can consist of any ERC-20 assets. During the initial stages, RTokens
    mostly include other cryptocurrencies, such as liquid staking tokens (e.g. stETH)
    or yield-bearing DeFi position (e.g. cUSDC). Eventually, the Reserve community
    will transition to more diverse baskets, which might include fiat currencies,
    securities, commodities and complex asset types, like synthetics and derivatives.
    Read more about Reserve’s long-term goals here: https://reserve.org/protocol/our_long_term_goal/

     

    How Many Reserve Rights (RSR) Coins Are There in Circulation?

    Reserve Rights has a fixed supply of 100 billion tokens. Out of this, about 52%
    are currently in circulation as of September 2024.

    The maximum token supply has already been pre-mined, but a large proportion is
    locked for various reasons, including 49.4% of the supply locked in a smart contract
    known as the "Slow wallet.” Funds from this wallet are released according to a
    deterministic schedule, which you can read more about here: https://blog.reserve.org/reducing-rsr-emissions-6da7f35917ba

    The Reserve Rights token initially launched with a circulating supply of 6.85
    billion tokens, of which 3% were distributed to Huobi Prime IEO participants,
    2.85% released as project tokens and 1% to private investors. All team, advisor,
    partner, and seed investor tokens have been unlocked via one of two options -
    one that has started in January 2022, and the other that started upon the launch
    of the full Reserve protocol on Ethereum mainnet. Read all about the Reserve Rights
    unlocking schedule here: https://reserve.org/protocol/reserve_rights_rsr/#reserve-rights-release-schedule.

     

    How Is the Reserve Rights Network Secured?

    Reserve Rights is currently an ERC-20 token based on the Ethereum blockchain.
    As a result, it is secured against attacks by a robust proof-of-work (POW) consensus
    mechanism backed by a network of thousands of Ethereum miners. 

     

    Where Can You Buy Reserve Rights (RSR)?

    Reserve Rights (RSR) is a popular token that currently maintains excellent liquidity. 

    It is available to purchase and trade on several of the most well-established
    cryptocurrency exchange platforms, including Binance, Huobi Global and OKX, and
    can be traded against various popular cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC),
    Tether (USDT) and Ethereum (ETH), as well as the U.S. dollar (USD) on multiple

  description: 'What is Basic Attention Token?

    A very common question when it comes to Basic Attention Token (BAT) is: “Why would
    Brave Browser need a token (BAT) for this?”. And the answer lies within Brave’s
    unusual, yet respectful approach to digital advertising. Brave’s advertisements
    are privacy centric (does not track the user), and are opt-in only (you only see
    it if you choose to). 

    And that’s where the Basic Attention Token (BAT) comes into play. Built on the
    Ethereum blockchain, and embedded into the Brave browser - it is an incentive
    token built into the browser to reward all players in the ecosystem - the user,
    advertiser and publisher.

    Who created Basic Attention Token?

    Basic Attention Token (BAT) is a cryptocurrency issued by Brave Inc. for their
    Brave Web Browser.

    Brave Web Browser was first founded in 2015 by web pioneer Brendan Eich (creator
    of JavaScript and former CEO of Mozilla Corporation) and CTO Brian Bondy. Following
    that, Brave browser launched in 2016 with its key feature of ad and tracker blocking.

    The Basic Attention Token was co-created by Eich and Bondy. The utility token
    was integrated into the browser and launched officially on May 31, 2017; it managed
    to raise $35 million.

    Why is Brave Browser interesting?

    Brave browser’s value proposition is its privacy-centric advertisements which
    does not track users, and that they are only opt-in. As users browse the web and
    opt into advertisements on Brave, they are rewarded with BAT for their attention.
    Publishers also receive a share of the BAT if they are able to retain quality
    users, while advertisers get better returns on their advertising funds by being
    able to reach quality audiences who are willing to pay attention to ads.

    Users who have BAT can also choose to automatically contribute their BAT tokens
    to publishers based on their attention spent on the website or to manually tip
    them. Some known publishers who have signed up with Brave include The Washington
    Post, Vice, The Guardian, and more. 

    How to earn Basic Attention Token (BAT)?

    In addition to purchasing BAT tokens, you can earn BAT through a few ways:



    Viewing ads served by the Brave browser. Brave mentions that you will earn 70%
    of their ad revenue that they receive from advertisers. In exchange for your attention,
    you will be able to accumulate tokens as you browse the web.






    Acquire random BAT rewards. These are worth between 25-40 BAT. These tokens typically
    become available monthly and users may claim it on a first-come-first-served basis.
    Users can claim this grant by clicking on the logo on the URL tab, and also through
    their Reward settings.



    Joining the Brave Rewards Creators program. If you are already a content creator
    or publisher, you can benefit from this program by earning BAT tokens. You can
    receive tips from visitors, have a share on viewed ads from visitors on your website
    or channel and through qualified referrals.  



    Do bear in mind that if you would like to withdraw BAT, you will need to complete
    the “Know Your Customer” (KYC) procedure with Uphold. Uphold is a partner custody
    service of Brave that acts as your BAT token wallet. However, should you choose
    to only contribute your BAT to publishers, KYC is not necessary.

    Where can I spend or use Basic Attention Token (BAT)?

    The Basic Attention Token is currently native to the Brave browser. As you are
    using Brave, you can choose to stream BAT tokens to publishers automatically or
    to tip your favourite publisher that you wish to support through Brave Rewards. 

    Brave Rewards lets you anonymously contribute to the sites you visit. In addition,
    your browser tallies the attention you spend on the sites you visit and divides
    up a monthly BAT contribution among sites based on your attention. Nobody will
    know which sites you visit or support — including the creators at Brave Software.

    The other use case for BAT is that you can collateralize it on Maker in order
    to mint new supply of DAI. This is a newly introduced feature by Maker as part
    of their Multi-Collateral Dai effort.

    How to mine Basic Attention Token?

    Unfortunately, BAT is non-mineable. This is because all the BAT that will exist
    has already been created during its ICO time. BAT can only be earned at the moment,
    as explained earlier.

    What are the benefits of Basic Attention Token?32>

    BAT is challenging the status quo by offering an alternative solution to paid
    advertising. In an online world where cookies track your browsing behaviour and
    your privacy compromised all in the name of optimizing ads revenue. BAT is a refreshing
    approach that aims to bring the power back to users while at the same time benefit
    publishers accordingly.

    Digital advertising will be disrupted in years to come as more and more internet
    consumers become more aware of protecting their privacy. Basic Attention Token
    may play a central role in terms of filling the revenue gap as users shy away
    from selling their privacy to advertising companies.'

  description: 'What Is Ankr (ANKR)?

    Ankr is a decentralized blockchain infrastructure provider that operates an array
    of nodes globally distributed across over 50 Proof-of-Stake networks. This infrastructure
    helps drive the growth of the crypto economy while powering a full suite of multi-chain
    tools for Web3 users:

    Ankr Build

    Ankr provides comprehensive blockchain developer solutions, including traditional
    APIs, a decentralized multi-chain network of public RPC nodes used to access blockchain
    data and execute code, and tools like Ankr Scan to view on-chain information across
    blockchains.  

    Ankr Earn

    Ankr Earn makes staking, liquid staking, and other yield-earning opportunities
    easy and accessible to any crypto investor. Ankr creates the most scalable and
    decentralized staking infrastructure solution that aims to solve the capital inefficiency
    of Proof-of-Stake networks and similar blockchain consensus mechanisms. 

    Ankr Learn

    Through Ankr’s learning tools, tutorials, and docs, anyone can become a better
    user or developer of blockchain-based systems. 

    Who Are the Founders of Ankr?

    Co-founders Chandler Song and Ryan Fang (Forbes 30 Under 30 laureates) founded
    Ankr in 2017 shortly after graduating from the University of California, Berkeley
    after being early participants in the Blockchain at Berkeley program. Chandler
    was working as an engineer at Amazon Web Services at the time where he met Stanley
    Wu, the third co-founder. Together, they took on a mission to build the most decentralized
    and scalable Web3 infrastructure possible. 

    What Makes Ankr Unique?

    Ankr is uniquely positioned as a node infrastructure and decentralized web services
    provider that allows DApps and blockchains to run and communicate with each other
    seamlessly while allowing users to earn more with their assets by delegating them
    easily to validator nodes. This is in contrast to centralized solutions like AWS
    Blockchain and many others.

    What Is the ANKR Token?

    ANKR is the native utility token needed for transactions and payments for many
    of Ankr’s services as well as platform governance. ANKR has capabilities as an
    ERC-20, BEP-2, and BEP-20 token, and it is also available on the Polygon, Avalanche,
    and Fantom networks.

    The ANKR token will play a core function in enabling institutional and independent
    node providers to monetize their nodes'' excess capacity and allow node consumers
    to benefit from a pay-as-you-go model, disrupting traditional blockchain API providers
    forcing users into paid plans requiring oversubscription.

    How Is Ankr Secured?

    Ankr utilizes auditor nodes in the block validation process on all supported blockchains
    to ensure that network quality is maintained and that any bad actors or poorly
    performing nodes are immediately removed from the system.

    In order to ensure total security with only good nodes in operation, Ankr employs
    a reputation-based system that evaluates all node contributions. Ankr also uses
    performance testing to fairly distribute and balance computational resources based
    on node workloads as well as Intel SGX memory encryption to maintain the highest
    levels of security against any potential hardware or software attacks.

    When it comes to off-chain data processing, the Native Oracle System, or NOS for
    short, relays information between on-chain smart contracts and off-chain data.
    The NOS is extremely secure with strong authentication requirements. The Data
    Source Security itself is handled through TLS 1.2,1.3 and Perfect Forward Security,
    or PFS.'

  description: 'What Is ZetaChain (ZETA)?

    ZetaChain is a novel L1 that has chain-agnostic interoperability built-in (EVM-compatible,
    Cosmos/IBC, Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Tron, etc.). Developers currently use ZetaChain’s
    messaging capabilities to send data and native value (without wrapping assets)
    between any chains. ZetaChain will also support native smart contracts, which
    let developers build omnichain dApps that orchestrate funds across chains from
    a single contract.

    Who Are the Founders of ZetaChain?

    ZetaChain’s founder was an early Coinbase employee and one of the creators of
    Basic Attention Token (BAT). Investors include all major market makers, top exchanges,
    early Coinbase and Binance employees including Dan Romero, Sam Rosenblum, and
    John Yi, as well as major contributors to some of the industry’s most widely adopted
    protocols and well known funds, including Polygon’s JD Kanani. Advisors to the
    project include Coinbase’s first Head of People Nathalie McGrath who scaled the
    industry leading exchange from 10 employees to over 800, and Juan Suarez, who
    served as in-house counsel at Coinbase from 2013 to 2022.

    What Makes ZetaChain Unique?

    ZetaChain is a blockchain that connects everything. It enables interoperability
    between any blockchains or layers by providing cross-chain value transfer and
    message delivery, as well as native omnichain smart contract support. Applications
    built on ZetaChain — omnichain dApps (odApps) — can leverage liquidity and data
    on multiple networks and read and update state on all connected networks. ZetaChain’s
    native omnichain smart contract platform lets developers deploy contracts with
    the same ease as developing dApps for a single network like Ethereum, that orchestrate
    data and value across many or all chains. ZetaChain’s connectivity is chain-agnostic
    and can connect to and bring smart contract capabilities to even non-smart-contract
    chains like Bitcoin and Dogecoin.'

  description: 'What is Illuvium?

    Illuvium is a decentralized gaming studio that merges online gaming with cryptocurrency.
    They create uniquely functional, evolving, and high production-value NFTs that
    are playable in a universe of play-to-earn gaming titles.

    Illuvium, their first game in development, is positioned to be the first blockchain-based
    AAA gaming title offering high-fidelity graphics and addictive gameplay. Their
    decentralized NFT collection and auto battler game is built on the Ethereum network
    and integrated with the hyper-scalable ImmutableX layer-two solution. ImmutableX
    gives the players of Illuvium access to zero gas fees for minting or exchanging
    assets, as well as sub-second transaction times, all with user-maintained custody.

    The genesis of Illuvium was a desire to make a collectible NFT game that was open,
    transparent and governed by the community 

    What is the premise of the game?

    Illuvium, a strangely shattered world with vast, difficult to traverse terrain.
    Locked on all sides by crystallized oceans, it is strewn with intriguing enigmas.
    Your society, a spacefaring colony since time immemorial, has arrived on this
    planet, and can’t get off of it. You are a hunter, as are the other stranded colonists
    from your ship. Surrounded by clues, you are working together to solve the mystery
    of what happened here.Vestiges of an ancient civilization are literally embedded
    into the landscape. Pure white Obelisks gleam in the distance, hinting at a technology
    now lost. The native creatures that populate the planet—deity-like beings that
    dominate the realm with elemental powers—are the collective clue, and core, of
    the mystery.

    Hunt them. Capture them. Uncover the history of this lost world. 

    What is the sILV and ILV token?

    $ILV token is used for governance, meaning anyone holding the token can vote on
    proposals that improve the game. $ILV token holders can also stake in the protocol
    to receive their portion of in-game revenues—currently set to 100%. 

    sILV is a Synthetic ILV token and can be used as in-game currency for things like
    enhancements, skins, and emotes. It can be earned by staking $ILV token in the
    protocol.

     

    How is the game governed?

    The Illuvinati Council is the governing entity of the game—representatives are
    elected in by $ILV token-holders. A large portion of the governance framework
    has been inspired by Synthetix Protocol. $ILV holders will be able to elect council
    members as a delegate and a quadratic voting process is used to vote for proposals.
    The Illuvinati Council is Illuvium’s initial governance model, and is subject
    to change. Illuvium strives to implement the best models of decentralized and
    decentralizing governance.'

  description: 'What is OriginTrail (TRAC)?

    OriginTrail is an ecosystem building a trusted knowledge infrastructure for artificial
    intelligence.It addresses the challenge of misinformation in the AI era by ensuring
    the origin of information and enabling discoverability of the world''s most important
    knowledge and real world assets (RWAs). 

    OriginTrail is creating a Verifiable Web for decentralized AI by empowering world
    class brands and builders. It utilizes its unique Decentralized Knowledge Graph and
    OriginTrail Parachain to deliver AI-powered search and solutions for enterprises
    and individuals worldwide.

    OriginTrail has gained support and partnerships with world-class organizations such
    as British Standards Institution, SCAN, Polkadot, Parity, Walmart, World Federation
    of Hemophilia, Oracle, and the EU Commission''s Next Generation Internet. These
    partnerships contribute to advancing OriginTrail''s trusted knowledge foundation
    and its applicability in trillion-dollar industries, while providing a verifiable
    web of knowledge important in particular to drive the economies of RWAs.

    The best way to see the technology in action is by checking ChatDKG, which is
    an experimental, question answering bot on X (Twitter) based on trusted Knowledge
    Assets in OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph. The ChatDKG provides answers
    based on OriginTrail trusted AI. 

    The Metcalfe phase of the updated roadmap pursues an ambitious goal of creating
    the world’s largest verifiable web for AI consisting of 100 billion Knowledge
    Assets, bringing a 100.000x scalability increase. As the name of the phase suggests,
    it will seek to produce network effects across the OriginTrail DKG and use novel
    techniques to pursue autonomous DKG growth based on the genesis knowledge foundation
    being created by organizations and individuals alike. The genesis part of the
    Metcalfe’s phase also introduces knowledge mining and knowledge signaling capabilities
    to drive constant growth of the Verifiable Web.

    Following the Genesis stage and the transition to an AI-native V8, further capabilities
    will become available in the Convergence stage. By leveraging the advancements
    in AI and the DKG, we will unlock autonomous knowledge mining which in turn leads
    to an autonomous DKG. At that stage, new knowledge gets added to the DKG with
    very limited human involvement. Services such as AI agents will be performing
    knowledge inferencing directly on the DKG to find any “blind spots” in the knowledge
    they can fill as well as search for new knowledge and bring it to the DKG in accordance
    with knowledge signaling.

    Who Are the Founders of OriginTrail?
